       "Thank you to Elaine Allard for teaching the librarians of New Hampshire about the ideas behind a learning commons .\n",
       "Thank you to Russ Harland , who read and reread the manuscript during one cold and stormy February vacation .\n",
       "He ’ ll be finishing his MLS in 2011 and looking for a library of his own .\n",
       "Thank you also to Mark Halloran for the support he has given to the library , and to Dr. Ethel Gaides for the support she has given to the librarians .\n",
       "Thank you to Erika Frank for sharing a well-designed vision in librarianship , and to Heather Armitage for inspiring me to keep writing .\n",
       "Introduction Our libraries are no longer book rooms , and adding computers into the mix does not make them computer rooms .\n",
       "We need to create a space that fosters collaborative work and social interaction amongst all of our users .\n",
       "When talking to librarians , we explain that we originally based our library program on the learning commons model at Plymouth State University ’ s Lamson Library .\n",
       "Our common goal is that we provide a single centralized location for all users to get help on all of the complex issues of teaching , researching , and being a student or teacher at our school .\n",
       "The learning commons idea is the library world ’ s answer to the changing informational and technological needs of today ’ s learners as well as a shift in pedagogical models .\n",
       "A proper learning commons is also constantly reevaluating the program and looking toward new ways to provide a space in which all users are learning collaboratively , experimenting with technologies , and customizing the space .\n",
       "In our learning commons , we encourage our faculty to serve as facilitators , and our students to have open discussions free of evaluation .\n",
       "One of the most common misconceptions that I have found when describing the learning commons idea to the uninitiated is that people often assume that I am recommending that we simply invest money into more computers or other technologies into the current library .\n",
       "People mistakenly believe that broadening services in the area of technology and spending a lot of money will magically shift a library into a learning commons , but I ’ m here to tell you differently .\n",
       "All you need to do is to shift your way of thinking from being the protector of information and resources to being the advocate for unfettered access to information and resources .\n",
       "Much like the way in which we share information through open-source software and tools , a learning commons is a space staffed by professionals who want to make all resources and information sources available to all users .\n",
       "We recently had several faculty members retire , and as we prepared for the transition and the parties , I went through our archived yearbook collection to find some classic snapshots of our retirees .\n",
       "The frightening thing to me was looking at the pictures of our classrooms and instructional facilities from 30 years ago and noticing that not much had changed .\n",
       "The hairstyles back then were funny , and everyone wore glasses .\n",
       "The chalkboards have been replaced with interactive whiteboards but are being used for the same thing .\n",
       "Teachers now simply type their lecture notes into PowerPoint instead of writing in chalk .\n",
       "Today , our students now have access to a virtual high school , and schools all over the country are looking toward moving more coursework online so that users have continual access to the information and resources that an old-fashioned brick-andmortar school and classroom provides .\n",
       "With access to so much information and the exponential growth of new technologies , learners and teachers of today need a professional to guide them .\n",
       "We need to be sure that we are providing the right kind of space , resources , and services for all of our users .\n",
       "A Note to Administrators The ideas described in this book are inexpensive , sometimes cost-saving ideas .\n",
       "These seven simple steps will streamline your library users ’ information seeking and processing methods , provide your library users with the ability to adapt easily to the future , and encourage all of your faculty and staff to work together .\n",
       "In order to adapt easily to changing roles and technologies , our spaces and staff need to remain flexible .\n",
       "Changes should be made based on what the user ’ s needs are , not on what is more convenient for the library staff .\n",
       "Barriers of all types need to be removed and exchanged for a trust in all of our users .\n",
       "Technology needs to be ubiquitous , and most of it should be transparent to users .\n",
       "The most difficult aspect of this shift in library experience is helping a librarian to change from being a guardian and protector of information and resources to being a guide to information and resources .\n",
       "A librarian also needs to develop the skills in technology planning and use .\n",
       "A computer is no longer just a computer .\n",
       "A computer can be a social equalizer , providing students who do not have access to the Internet at home the means to create a social identity online to rival those of the most upper-class students .\n",
       "A computer can be a digital portfolio of all of a user ’ s academic work and digital personal life .\n",
       "Computers may be mobile , they may have installed digital media readers , and they may have movie-editing software .\n",
       "Every library needs a professional who can understand what the users need and provide timely access to those resources .\n",
       "But most importantly , a librarian needs to be an advocate for all learners .\n",
       "People enjoy seeing quantifiable statistics with any change , and library services are easy to count and keep track of .\n",
       "Expect publications in the form of monthly statistical reports as well as newsletter-type stories with descriptions of the changes and the impact on the library and the rest of the community .\n",
       "User-Centered Design is a popular software design philosophy and process in which the user ’ s needs are given priority over all other options .\n",
       "By taking this philosophy and transferring it to library redesign , we can make our libraries the most user-friendly spaces on campus .\n",
       "Before your next physical or virtual library redesign , think about the following questions .\n",
       "Try to think of everybody who might use your library in the future .\n",
       "It may be difficult for you to focus on what a student is thinking when they walk into your library without being influenced by what you learned in school about what a library should look like—or more likely , what your own library experience may be .\n",
       "Many libraries use a legacy-centered model , using the same design ideas that librarians have used for decades and even centuries .\n",
       "Your library may have an ingrained tradition that you hesitate to change because it has worked for years .\n",
       "The first step to shifting your library is to let go of some of these guidelines .\n",
       "The shift is brought about by the need for new services , tools , and resources .\n",
       "One basic change that you can make is in the use of language in your library .\n",
       "Most libraries are categorized , arranged , and labeled using language from the lexicon of librarians .\n",
       "Instead , use simple and descriptive terms that any user can understand .\n",
       "Label the areas of your library clearly and then use that language while talking to your users .\n",
       "One of our goals is to teach students about the structure of libraries , but let ’ s make sure that they know how to use our resources before we begin teaching them the specialized language of our profession .\n",
       "We do not want to send students off to the next academic level without an understanding of these terms , so be sure to include lessons on specialized language with more advanced classes .\n",
       "Another aspect of user-centered design is taking all of the cultural information that you have and combining it with the observations you have made , the interviews you have conducted , and all other collected data to analyze and brainstorm your results .\n",
       "When you talk to students , they may not be able to articulate the exact ideas that you implement .\n",
       "Instead , they will point you in the right direction .\n",
       "You may observe a student who seems annoyed at having to come back to your desk to get a second red marker because the one she was using had dried up .\n",
       "Note this reaction and consider some different alternatives .\n",
       "Think about how you might explain what each database is best used for in future collaborative lessons .\n",
       "Users will not be able to tell you specifically how to redesign your Web site , but their questions and frustrations will guide you in the right direction .\n",
       "When you hear complaining and whining , prick up your ears and Figure 1.1 .\n",
       "If you can make a change to prevent future complaints , do it right away .\n",
       "Keep a keen eye on how your users utilize your facility and the resources held within .\n",
       "The more we understand how our users are using our resources and adapt our facilities toward them , the more relevant our libraries will become .\n",
       "As you learn more about your users , you will see that their needs are constantly changing , and the best learning commons will be able to adapt to their users ’ needs .\n",
       "The Plymouth Model In 2006 , we had a basic legacy-design library .\n",
       "Yearbooks , gluesticks , and other resources that students wanted to use on a daily basis were kept behind the large counter that served as the information desk .\n",
       "This desk essentially spanned across the entire front half of the library .\n",
       "The counter served as a large barrier between the library staff and the users .\n",
       "It also protected our most-used resources from the users who needed them .\n",
       "We had a room filled with dust-collecting slide projectors , never-used laser-disc players , and a historical archive of projector bulbs going back nearly 40 years .\n",
       "We had televisions and VCRs hooked up to our cable connection allowing the professional librarian to record television broadcasts for classroom use .\n",
       "We also had a large selection of seldom-used print periodicals .\n",
       "The magazines were housed in spinning literature racks that blocked out the cover of each magazine , only revealing the top two inches of each cover page , occasionally revealing the actual title of the magazine .\n",
       "We had a security system that went off several times per day as students found it entertaining to place a library book in an unsuspecting student ’ s backpack .\n",
       "The library staff would get flustered , the students would all laugh , and we would inevitably find a book about human sexuality or something equally humiliating for the backpack wearer .\n",
       "Incoming freshmen would come in for an introductory lesson on how to use the library .\n",
       "Each class came in with their English teachers , and the librarians would show them a digital slide presentation with the rules of the library .\n",
       "Students were excited to enter the library but were soon distracted and bored while watching the presentation and listening to us talk about what they were not allowed to do in the library .\n",
       "Nothing seemed crazy or out of the ordinary .\n",
       "It was business as usual for most libraries for the past several decades .\n",
       "When looking critically at our 2006 legacy-model , we were hard-pressed to find significant value in our system .\n",
       "We spent that school year watching our users and how they used our library .\n",
       "We talked to students about what they really needed in a library .\n",
       "We listened to teachers who came in requesting resources and then watched to see how they used them .\n",
       "We created different surveys for school employees and for parents , too .\n",
       "We spent the summer of 2007 reviewing the survey results and making some very basic changes to our library .\n",
       "We purchased some inexpensive office supply organization bins .\n",
       "We recommend that you not use old coffee cans , shoe boxes , and milk crates .\n",
       "We strive to establish and maintain a professional atmosphere in our learning commons .\n",
       "We are trying to expose our users to what a professional experience will be like when they are not in school .\n",
       "Creating a professional atmosphere also raises expectations and helps to set a tone for being in the library and using the library ’ s resources .\n",
       "Allow students open access to these supplies—you ’ ll be surprised at how many of the supplies do not disappear .\n",
       "You will have an initial onslaught of disappearing scissors and rulers , but as the students get used to the fact that these supplies are not going away , your users will become more trustworthy and honest about returning the supplies .\n",
       "A secondary benefit of providing users with unlimited office supplies is that teachers will notice that their classroom supplies are remaining stocked .\n",
       "Students tend to use the supplies provided in a centralized location like the library .\n",
       "Your principal will notice that teacher supply accounts are not being fully spent , so you may approach him or her with a request to increase the library supply account .\n",
       "Encourage your principal to talk to teachers about their supply accounts , and you may end up with a budget increase .\n",
       "This includes the supplies that we need to run the library , too .\n",
       "Another benefit to keeping your supplies in organizational bins is portability .\n",
       "Students can take an entire bin of markers or colored pencils to their table to work , rather than bringing their work up to the supplies .\n",
       "Watch your users and see how they are using supplies to create finished products .\n",
       "Put yourself in the shoes of a student and ask how you would want supplies to appear .\n",
       "Think about creating a workshop-type environment for your users .\n",
       "In order to create a comfortable atmosphere , go out and look at professional copy centers with work spaces .\n",
       "Be open minded and watch how the users are using and enjoying the space .\n",
       "Pick out the aspects that you could realistically implement in your library .\n",
       "Perhaps the furniture is unreasonable because the cost would prohibit you from purchasing new soft seating , low tables , and bookshelves with outfacing book covers .\n",
       "Be mindful about changes that you could make in your space , and your users will appreciate it .\n",
       "We asked all departments to give us a copy of all current textbooks .\n",
       "Your textbook shelves will be in regular disarray because they will be constantly in use .\n",
       "Students will request fewer trips to their lockers and have fewer excuses for not completing their homework .\n",
       "Our students come to the high school from eight different K–8 schools .\n",
       "Three of those schools have wonderful libraries with full-time librarians providing instruction , collection development , and reader guidance .\n",
       "Two of those schools have combined school-public libraries with the expectation that the students will use only the children ’ s section and leave the adult books to the public .\n",
       "Obviously , our incoming student users have a huge range of prior experience .\n",
       "We try to even the playing field early by inviting the eighth-graders from the schools with the smallest library facilities to visit our library in the spring before they start at the high school .\n",
       "We have the students follow a scavenger hunt through the library and work with the guidance department to include a school tour .\n",
       "We also encourage all of our freshman English and social studies teachers to bring their students to the library as early in the school year as possible in order to expose all of our freshmen to the resources available to them in our library .\n",
       "For their first visit , we have the class sit down in a quiet section of our library .\n",
       "We talk about the resources to which they now have access in their high school library .\n",
       "We then hustle them over to the computers and teach them how to log on to our school network and access our library Web site .\n",
       "If the classes are doing any kind of research project , we show them a single database and demonstrate to them how to use it for their specific assignment .\n",
       "Changing from a text-heavy slide presentation about what they cannot do in the library to hands-on entertaining and integrated lessons keeps our freshmen engaged and allows them to make more relevant connections to the library resources .\n",
       "Technology Accessories sary in any room , especially in our learning commons .\n",
       "They are negative and constant reminders that set the tone of your space as prohibitive .\n",
       "If you must post rules , be creative instead of restrictive .\n",
       "Users appreciate the humor and understand the tone of the space as they first enter the room .\n",
       "We noticed that we were subscribing to a number of expensive professional journals that were rarely being accessed .\n",
       "We decided that instead of attaching a routing list to the journals , we would photocopy the cover page and table of contents and send these packets of information to faculty members who might be interested in the contents .\n",
       "We suddenly had lines of faculty waiting to get their hands on the newest issues of the English Journal and the Science Teacher .\n",
       "By publicizing available resources for our teachers , we increased use of these journals dramatically—many teachers were unaware that we had these titles available at all .\n",
       "We heavily weeded our print reference collection based on access to electronic resources with the same information .\n",
       "We also moved a lot of our single-volume monograph titles from reference to the regular circulating collection .\n",
       "Items that are alphabetical multivolume sets are difficult to circulate , but sets that are divided by topics are also generally moved to our circulating collection .\n",
       "In addition to weeding reference , we heavily weeded the circulating collection .\n",
       "This quickly updated our collection as library users suddenly believed that we had added a lot of new titles without our actually having added any .\n",
       "Weeding is a crucial step to transforming any out-of-date library .\n",
       "Preserving inaccurate and out-of-date materials on your library shelves is one way to demonstrate to your users just how irrelevant print materials really are .\n",
       "We discarded most of the unused audiovisual equipment from our back room and weeded through the light bulbs , taping supplies , and other outdated resources .\n",
       "This freed up space for spreading out our professional collections , digital audiovisual equipment , and video collections .\n",
       "Now when teachers walk into our back room , they barely recognize it as the same space .\n",
       "Keeping library space neat and organized is crucial to demonstrating a professional atmosphere for your users .\n",
       "We also ordered some very simple wall-mounted magazine display racks , such as those in Figure 1.6 .\n",
       "We looked for racks that had Plexiglas fronts so that users could see the entire front cover of each periodical title .\n",
       "We used to dust the periodical racks weekly because users never touched them .\n",
       "We now have to check the displays daily to reorganize , re-alphabetize , and straighten out this popular section .\n",
       "Virtual Library Redesign We redesigned our library Web site based on what our users needed and wanted .\n",
       "In the middle of our observational and evaluative year , our users found an immediate need that we chose to implement quickly .\n",
       "Often , coded text I would send would not translate between vanilla HTML and Dreamweaver , and almost every change required explanation and often more than one revision .\n",
       "We found that students were asking for links to commonly visited Web sites over and over again .\n",
       "I wanted to be able to send the link right to the student ’ s computer , and students expected that I could make this happen .\n",
       "We wanted a tool that allowed us to focus on the content rather than the technology .\n",
       "We initially chose to create the Web site as a wiki ; however , a blog or other Web 2.0–based tool would have suited us just fine , too .\n",
       "On each page , we provided links to Web sites and research hints that we wanted to share with the students .\n",
       "Since we also integrated e-books and virtual resources with our print volumes and brick-and-mortar space , we included access to them on our wiki page .\n",
       "Once you set up your own wiki page , you may realize that your teachers also want to share Web sites with their students—so give your wiki password to all faculty .\n",
       "From The Learning Commons : Seven Simple Steps to Transform Your Library by Pamela Colburn Harland .\n",
       "Maybe you can see where this is going , but back in September 2006 , I never would have believed it .\n",
       "By December 2006 , we had the first students who wanted to share Web sites with their classmates .\n",

       "Every time we talked to a user , we added the discussion to the list on the clipboard .\n",
       "Sometimes we only had time to write down a couple of words , other times we would make a checkmark next to another question already on the list to indicate that we have answered the same question an additional time , and other times we wrote complete paragraphs explaining a detailed reference interview .\n",
       "We were surprised to see that after a week , we rarely added to the question list .\n",

       "Each instance is unique and often based on prior experience with that user .\n",
       "In the second case , we found that if users wanted to be pointed to the shelves for their own independent browsing , they often still could not find the resources on the shelves from a brief description across the library .\n",
       "Our users responded positively right away with the new aisle numbers .\n",
       "It became much easier to point a student to the books at the end of aisle four .\n",
       "If you find yourself handing out glue sticks all day long , the glue sticks are obviously in the wrong place .\n",

       "The system asks the user to enter a book that they like reading and then generates a report of other titles that the user may like based on some descriptive parameters .\n",
       "Several students experimented with these systems and reported back to us that they would much rather talk to us about book titles that we can guarantee that we have in our library .\n",
       "Numerous users shied away from these results , too , and said that they would prefer to talk to a real person about book recommendations .\n",
       "We were thrilled to get such honest feedback and are always happy to assist readers in book choices .\n",

       "Also share some of the high-touch tasks for which your technology people are not available in the middle of a busy school day .\n",
       "Keep this in mind when thinking about creating your own learning commons .\n",
       "You may already be doing a large philosophical shift that is difficult to make happen in larger schools and libraries .\n",
       "Technology administrators are usually in charge of filtering the access to information .\n",
       "While they are perfectly qualified to filter access from a compliant standpoint , you could argue that a librarian has more expertise in determining the quality of that access as it relates to academics and research .\n",
       "This shift is an important one , and something that could be done today .\n",
       "We work together with our technology staff in blocking and allowing access to information via the Web .\n",
       "Oftentimes , the technology administrators feel more like gatekeepers , blocking access to what they believe to be inappropriate materials .\n",
       "Librarians , on the other hand , are usually gate openers .\n",
       "We are the professionals in a building looking for ways to provide the most people with the most information .\n",
       "It makes sense to me that librarians should be involved in a large part of content filtering .\n",
       "Simply adding more computers to your library space does not make an information commons .\n",
       "Adding more computers because your users need them to meet their academic needs may be a part of your shift .\n",
       "However , the more important aspect is working together with the technology individuals that support your library .\n",
       "The technology department is rarely interacting with learners as much as the library squad is .\n",
       "Be sure to keep them informed of what all of your users are asking for and talking about .\n",
       "If you and your library squad are granted some level of technology administration , not only are you interfacing with users more often , but you are reinforcing the learning commons model in action by being the go-to resource for basic technology questions and problems .\n",
       "Also , by working closely with the technology department , you will have another level of professional in the building invested in making the learning commons model more successful .\n",
       "Together , we will be able to help our users with their information needs better that if we were helping them on our own .\n",
       "One way to see which resources or services need to work together is to track unmonitored referrals .\n",
       "Keep track of anytime a user asks you a question that requires you to send the user out of the library .\n",
       "Volunteer to manage additional equipment or perform additional functions such as resetting passwords or giving out SAT test information .\n",
       "Discuss with administration about including these locations , resources , and equipment in the new information commons area .\n",
       "Most large-sized libraries have multiple information desks in one library .\n",
       "One desk to answer all questions is the perfect illustration of simplicity for users .\n",
       "Librarians all over the world love to share information and resources .\n",
       "The librarians of your local district may meet monthly to discuss sharing assets , but the most valuable thing that you can share with each other is ideas .\n",
       "Make sure to meet with other professional librarians monthly .\n",
       "If you are having trouble with a specific issue , you can guarantee that several other librarians are dealing with the same issue .\n",
       "As an active member in a professional librarian association , you can offer to work at a conference in exchange for free admission to the conference .\n",
       "In addition to attending the conference and working at it , you will also have the added pleasure of getting to meet hundreds of other friendly librarians .\n",
       "Create a group in a social networking site and invite your fellow librarians to join .\n",

       "In addition , we also attempt to talk in person every day .\n",
       "We don ’ t always cross paths on a daily basis , but it is our unofficial goal to speak or stay in contact every day .\n",
       "As we were first beginning to join resources , we moved 40 computers and a networked printer into the library .\n",
       "Because the library suddenly became the largest computer lab in the school , we found that we needed to communicate more frequently .\n",
       "As more users filtered into the library for technology-related issues , we continued to see what they needed and offered them solutions .\n",
       "Soon , when any user had a technology-related question , they called the library .\n",
       "We became the driving force behind allowing students to use portable devices for storing and sharing information .\n",
       "We pushed for open access to resources such as video-sharing Web sites , micro-blogging services , and e-mail for all students .\n",
       "Simply opening the lines of communication between the library and the technology department allowed many of our initiatives to come to fruition .\n",
       "When communicating with the technology department , be sure to do your research first , and then explain that your needs are driven by the needs of your users .\n",
       "When we requested a color printer for the library , it was not because the library squad was hoping to print out our reports in color , although that is a benefit for us .\n",
       "Students were unable to print out a draft of a digital art project in color before they sent their projects through the art teacher ’ s high-resolution printer .\n",
       "Teachers were unable to print out data charts with different color labels for each data set without a color printer .\n",
       "We researched color printers using consumer comparison Web sites , we did ink-refill-cost comparisons , and asked colleagues via a micro-blogging service .\n",
       "We gathered all of our information together and went to the technology department with our requests , our research , and our examples of why our users needed a color printer available in the library .\n",
       "The following summer , we had a new color printer , and our users were able to use it on the first day of school .\n",
       "Auxiliary Faculty The administration , seeing that we were the leaders in technology across the school , decided to move the digital portfolio coordinator to under the umbrella of the library .\n",
       "In the state of New Hampshire , every student must collect and reflect on their digital artifacts of learning into a digital portfolio .\n",
       "We thought that it made sense for students and faculty to have a place within the school where they could ask questions , access resources , and share information .\n",
       "Students began stopping first in our library for all levels of digital portfolio assistance .\n",
       "We also saw that students were asking for some very specific assistance in the areas of math , English , and language arts .\n",
       "We changed our library duty position , the person who used to check passes , into a library tutor .\n",
       "We ordered a professionally designed laminate sign for the library , moved two more desks into the library under the sign , and seated our new tutors at these desks .\n",
       "Faculty members now write library passes specifically for working with tutors , and as students sign into the library , they are directed to the tutoring stations .\n",
       "The library staff is highly trained in assisting students with specialized information and technology resources ; but we were never prepared to answer mathematics questions , and those questions would usually result in an unmonitored referral outside of the library .\n",
       "If you are fortunate enough to provide specialized tutoring in your library , be sure to keep statistics on the number of service interactions between tutors and users .\n",
       "These statistics will be invaluable to the administration at budget time .\n",
       "Proceed with the goal that you are building an elite library squad .\n",
       "Surround yourself with the people who are proactive and eager to learn .\n",
       "We found that when were hiring a new paraprofessional in the library , we all benefitted from hiring a technology aide rather than an aide more experienced in libraries .\n",
       "An aide already trained in technology , especially resources-sharing technologies , is a valuable hire .\n",
       "We found that people with existing library experience often had their own prejudices to extinguish before they could accurately understand the goals that we had established for our library in our shift toward a learning commons .\n",
       "Adding well-educated and social individuals to your library squad will help your team to work together to make a better learning commons .\n",
       "In fact , I have heard librarians say that they went to library school because they liked books more than people or that they specifically did not have anything to sell .\n",
       "Unfortunately , due to budget restraints and the availability of mobile information , administrators are looking at all areas within their organizations for cuts .\n",
       "Librarians do have something very serious to sell .\n",
       "At school and academic libraries , we also have the task of teaching our users how to find their own information .\n",
       "We need to constantly prove our value to the stakeholders .\n",

       "People are always thrilled to have an extra pair of hands during an overwhelming conference week .\n",
       "You will also get to meet lots of like-minded librarians , probably attend the conference for free , and learn a little something along the way .\n",

       "It is one of the most difficult steps , but once you open your locked cabinets to your users , you will spend a lot less time handing out glue sticks and yearbooks and more time teaching information literacy and collaborating with faculty .\n",
       "I know how safe it feels to stand behind the counter .\n",
       "It strongly represents a barrier , protecting the library staff and everything else that sits behind the counter from the users .\n",
       "The shift here is to change your philosophy from protecting resources and materials to guiding your users .\n",
       "When I was in graduate school , we were still studying preservation and archiving of print collections .\n",
       "This is part of the longstanding library legacy that we have learned and used for centuries .\n",
       "The problem exists when we extend those feelings of preservation and protection to resources such as glue sticks .\n",
       "Through informal research , we found that users of all kinds felt that a counterlevel desk or any other kind of large furniture , was uninviting .\n",
       "Students relate it to a judge ’ s bench in a courtroom , the main desk at a police station , or a teller ’ s counter at a bank .\n",
       "Our students are not comfortable approaching these unfamiliar places , and they extended that feeling to our library information desk .\n",
       "Users feel like they have to ask the question the right way , even when they do not necessarily know what the question is .\n",
       "They felt like they were being judged by those of us behind the counter .\n",
       "We designed a welcoming low desk with some surrounding counters as our main desk as in Figure 5.1 .\n",
       "We wanted to be sure that students did not feel that they could help themselves to parts of the desk , as we frequently have books that have not yet been checked in , or materials on reserve for other users on our desk .\n",
       "I also continue to find a lot of valuable resources behind every librarian ’ s desk that I have visited .\n",
       "More often than not , office supplies are located behind the desk .\n",
       "I completely understand the need to guard the supplies against waste and reckless use .\n",
       "But I guarantee that the day you put the supplies on the other side of the desk is the day that you suddenly have more time to spend on innovative ideas , collaboration with faculty , and facilitating information literacy with the students in your library .\n",
       "These resources are for the users , not for the protecting .\n",
       "Librarians are worried about theft , destruction , and inappropriate use of these materials .\n",
       "I encourage you to buy extra copies of the materials that are overused or too popular to actually trust in the hands of a student .\n",
       "Take a chance by shifting how you share resources with your users .\n",
       "Emotional Barriers Not all barriers are physical barriers .\n",
       "Some librarians , including myself on the most frantic days , give off the vibe of being too busy to talk .\n",
       "No user wants to ever hear how busy you are .\n",
       "The library squad should not be displaying leisure , but a library is not a place for panic and stress , either .\n",
       "Most of us have an unending job to do behind that computer monitor , so I have several suggestions for how to be more approachable .\n",
       "When I first introduce myself to students , I explain to them that they are welcome to come into my office whenever they have a question for me .\n",
       "I warn them that I may look busy , because most of the time I am working on my computer .\n",
       "I assure them that I would much rather be talking to them than working on my computer , so I encourage them to interrupt me , no matter how seriously busy I look at my computer .\n",
       "That is such a menacing , but all too common , experience for a young student or uninitiated library user .\n",
       "If a user is asking you for help , take the time to show them what they need .\n",
       "One of the most beneficial things that you can do is to create a space without these types of barriers .\n",
       "Fear , intimidation , and trepidation are adjectives that should not be associated with your library space .\n",
       "Try to put yourself in your users ’ positions and think of how you would like to be treated .\n",
       "I imagine that users appreciate the invitation to approach a professional sitting at a desk behind a computer , seemingly engrossed in a project that is more important than you .\n",
       "Take the time to think of alternative ways that you can take down invisible barriers , too .\n",
       "Working with Faculty We attracted faculty to the library in a number of ways .\n",
       "We were never too busy to talk to a faculty member who walked into our office .\n",
       "If they want to talk and they are coming to you , make the time to welcome them and help them to feel included in decisions happening at the library .\n",
       "Insisting that teachers make appointments , fill out forms , or happen to stop by when you have nothing at all to do is a huge barrier for busy faculty members .\n",
       "You may have to increase staffing in order to be able to triage your user ’ s needs , so that you always have time to talk to all of your users .\n",
       "Several times each day , we have faculty and staff stopping by for a chocolate break .\n",
       "Frequently , while they grab a handful of candy , our conversation turns from casual greetings to collaboration on a project .\n",
       "After two years of forcing myself onto our faculty , and not letting up , I now have most of the faculty stopping by at the first thought of a research project .\n",
       "The library has become the place that teachers can rely on for providing valuable resources as well as information-literacy lessons to their students .\n",
       "We do not force teachers to fill out forms in order to schedule a class visit or a collaboration meeting in the library .\n",
       "We find that teachers have too much going on .\n",
       "If we want them to utilize the librarian ’ s skills and our resources , then we must remove barriers such as forms and other unnecessary administrative steps that we used to insist faculty jump through .\n",
       "It is extremely low-tech , but it is the best tool for us to keep track of our calendar and upcoming research projects and class visits .\n",
       "We have considered making it available on our Web site or our shared network space so that teachers could be constantly informed of our schedule , but we have not moved in that direction for several reasons : 1 .\n",
       "We prefer to have teachers come into the library when signing up for time with us .\n",
       "This offers us the opportunity to discuss projects , needs , and tools with the teachers .\n",
       "When between classes , it is faster for us to look down at the binder on the desk rather than check a computer .\n",
       "Encourage the rest of your library squad to increase their social interactions , especially if you have new staff working in the library .\n",
       "This removes a barrier of not actually knowing who it is that works in the library .\n",
       "We want our library squad to be social and approachable , and we want people to know who they are when they walk into the library .\n",
       "Making an effort to connect with our patrons encourages them to develop a relationship with us that will increase the likelihood that they will use our services and materials and support the library when it comes to budget time .\n",

       "This will remind your users to utilize your databases even when they were expecting to find a traditional print resource .\n",
       "MARC records can be downloaded from the database vendors and include a link directly to the resource .\n",
       "We found that this increased the use of several databases the month that we included the MARC records in our library catalog .\n",
       "A Note to Database Vendors and Electronic Resource Providers I am sure it is the hope of all librarians that database vendors and electronic resource providers will agree on some standardized or customizable search standard that will make all electronic resources as user friendly and easy to use as the rest of our libraries .\n",
       "We are looking toward simplicity , customizability , and user-centered design .\n",
       "Some electronic resources require a special reader to be installed on the computer .\n",
       "This prevents students from being able to access some of our online resources , even from computers in the school library .\n",
       "Most electronic resources are now available in any Web browser , but before you purchase anything new , be sure to ask questions about access .\n",
       "The lesson here is to stay away from proprietary electronic resources , use a basic Web browser as the tool as most users have free and existing access already to a simple Web browser .\n",
       "Much like the special readers for electronic resources , several audiobook and e-book suppliers create proprietary interfaces .\n",

       "We constantly keep a list of blogging and micro-blogging ideas to use for future posts .\n",
       "We set up a simple word-processing document on our network shared space , so that everyone on the library squad has access to it .\n",
       "Throughout the school year , we all can share ideas on this simple document .\n",
       "When it comes time to start a new issue of our newsletter or we feel the need to add a new blog entry , we open the document and scan through our ideas to find one that is relevant and meaningful .\n",
       "Once it is over , we document it through our photo-sharing and blog tools .\n",
       "We make every attempt to keep our writing conversational , approachable , and inviting so that all users will want to keep coming back to our tools .\n",
       "Once we are approachable in our virtual worlds , users will feel more comfortable approaching us via e-mail and in person , too .\n",
       "When we remodeled our Web presence , we made sure that in addition to creating a user-friendly and flexible Web site , any and all barriers were removed .\n",
       "We included several widgets with direct links to our photo-sharing account , micro-blogging account , and online version of our statistics and newsletter .\n",
       "We wanted to make sure that everything we do would be readily accessible from this one virtual space .\n",
       "We do not want to have any barriers between our users and the online information that we provide to them .\n",
       "Creating a confusing or complicated Web site is just like putting print resources that your users need to use in a locked-up room .\n",

       "In addition to removing any virtual barriers , we also took the time to remove physical barriers .\n",
       "We were fortunate to be able to redesign our checkout desk .\n",
       "We created a much smaller unit in the front corner of the library .\n",
       "We removed a huge barrier of a counter with bookshelves in front of it that expanded all the way across the front of the library .\n",
       "With this one project , we created an open atmosphere in the library that cannot be undone .\n",
       "With very few changes , visitors now come in to the library and exclaim that the library is very open and inviting .\n",

       "Sometimes I ’ m in the mood for some professional development , sometimes I want to read a young adult mystery , and other times I am hankering for a good old graphic novel .\n",
       "Show your users that you trust them by allowing them to check out as many books as they want .\n",
       "Just because you are worried about a small number of users who will keep their materials for too long—or worse , lose them—you can trust most of your users with a more liberal policy allowing unrestricted access to your print resources .\n",
       "Providing students with a wide variety of resources is only one part of creating an information commons .\n",
       "The space that you create must be filled with open collaboration and an open exchange of ideas .\n",
