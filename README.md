### Facebook version
- Change this line to contain your facebook plain text login data: https://github.com/mrzl/TheOracle/blob/master/src/node/facebook-advanced-echo.js#L16
- Adjust the threadId of the person you want to chat with here: https://github.com/mrzl/TheOracle/blob/master/src/node/facebook-advanced-echo.js#L42 and https://github.com/mrzl/TheOracle/blob/master/src/node/facebook-advanced-echo.js#L23 (it's being printed when you receive a message. At the moment I haven't fount a better way of getting the threadId of one conversation.)
- Run it via 
```
node facebook-advanced-echo.js
```
- Run https://github.com/mrzl/TheOracle/blob/master/src/main/java/oracle/SimpleOracle.java (or an exported jar.)


### for gifs
create the folder in data:
- gifs/clean
- gifs/gify
- gifs/*

gifs are git-ignored and stored on lyrik...

in the config.properties there is a new property called:
DOWNLOAD_GIFY, guess what it does.
You will get the Gif anyway but storing them might be more fun, and it sometimes constructing Gif Object
with an URL seems to fail.
