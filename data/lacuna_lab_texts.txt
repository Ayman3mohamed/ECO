1.

México es un país con una tradición textil heredada desde tiempos prehispánicos. En la época colonial los españoles se maravillaban de la eficiencia de las tejedoras indígenas y de hecho consideraban innecesario el enseñarles a tejer, porque “eran mejores tejedoras que las propias maestras españolas.” 1

Los materiales utilizados en la época colonial era el algodón, la lana, la seda y el ixtle. En ese entonces, las herramientas para la producción consistían en telar de pedal y telar de cintura, usado por las mujeres indígenas.

La producción de textiles satisfacía a una pequeña población y en muchos casos continuaba siendo para consumo propio al interior de las familias, en otras ocasiones, las telas se utilizaban como moneda en el pago de impuestos a la corona española.

Con el paso del tiempo, los materiales, las técnicas, herramientas, máquinas y el consumo cambió. Con la introducción de nuevas telas y brocados el textil mexicano se transformaba.

2.

El textil en México representaba para muchas comunidades la interacción colectiva, la reunión de los integrantes de la familia, desde la siembra del algodón hasta el tejido.

En este proceso se hacían y rehacían alianzas, amistades, etcétera. En el proceso se enseñaba, de abuelos a nietos, el sentido cultural y la destreza de una actividad artesanal, adquiriendo así un significado relevante con un acto con el que el hombre y su sociedad producen y reproducen tanto su cultura material como espiritual. 2

La actividad textil se desarrollaba entre las mujeres, abuelas, nietas, madres e hijas que se encargaban de transmitir el conocimiento por generaciones.

Desde tiempos prehispánicos, la actividad textil en México "significaba más que una simple técnica para producir telas; se consideraba un don sagrado que los mismos dioses otorgaban a las mujeres".3

En diversos   pueblos de Oaxaca todavía se utilizan técnicas prehispánicas en la producción textil. El proceso comienza después de cosechar el algodón, cuando las mujeres, niñas y ancianas separan manualmente las semillas de las fibras. Una vez limpio el algodón, éste se extiende sobre un bulto, hecho con hojas de plátano, atado y cubierto con un petate. Las vareadoras toman dos pares de varas, uno en cada mano, y comienzan  a golpear sobre el algodón. Con esta operación las fibras del algodón se separan, se "aflojan y esponjan", condición que facilita el siguiente paso que es la transformación u ordenación de esas fibras en un solo hilo continuo.

Posteriormente, la tejedora, se allega sus instrumentos para hilar: el malacate, una jícara pequeña y un pedacito de cal.  4

Los procesos artesanales del algodón que aún sobreviven en algunas comunidades nos da una breve enseñanza de cómo se formaban las estructuras sociales de los pueblos indígenas en torno a los textiles.

3.

En los últimos años el sector textil en el área artesanal ha sufrido una gran baja en ventas como resultado de:

 • La pérdida del autoconsumo y el consumo regional de productos tradicionales reemplazado por un nuevo consumidor urbano con necesidades diferentes.

• La falta de viabilidad de un ingreso digno para las nuevas generaciones de artesanos que provoca cambio de ocupación y/o la migración a los Estados Unidos y a los centros urbanos.

• El impacto de productos importados (en particular productos provenientes de países asiáticos) los cuales compiten en innovación, diseño, precio y volumen de producción. 5

Cuando se teje se clarifican y recrean historias reactivando los mismos acontecimientos míticos que constituyen el origen de un grupo o etnia.

En cada reactualización que realiza el hombre al tejer logra encontrar la oportunidad de transformar su existencia para crear su propio modelo dentro de los espacios profanos y sagrados de la organización y vida cultural.

Mircea Eliade

4.

San Juan Cotzocón se localiza en la sierra mixe del estado de Oaxaca.

En este lugar las artesanas trabajan con telar de cintura, una técnica textil con un valor histórico muy importante en la transmisión del conocimiento entre grupos de mujeres.

Es con el trabajo de telar con el que se obtienen piezas como el tradicional huipil, rebozos, blusas, servilletas, manteles, ropa para niña, bolsas entre otros productos que ellas mismas confeccionan a mano.

El manejo de la técnica es dominado por las mujeres mixes desde la infancia a través de la enseñanza familiar.

El manejo y control del telar permite a las mujeres avanzar muy rápidamente en tejidos hechos a mano utilizando hilos sintéticos.

5.

Fomentar redes productivas de trabajo local que no comprometan la calidad de un producto por el hecho de utilizar materiales en desuso puede crearse a través de la difusión del conocimiento y el intercambio de técnicas con el fin de contribuir a la construcción de una sociedad más propositiva e informada.

El trabajo de un diseñador más allá de la empresa o del despacho y la participación activa en la comunidad es un campo que presenta mucha posibilidades y un panorama que está por dibujarse en un país como México, cada vez más carente de oportunidades.

6. “Somos lo que hacemos. Somos el producto de nuestras acciones”.

Este año Modopactua redefine y revalora las acciones llevadas a cabo hasta ahora y traza un camino con las experiencias y colaboraciones que han llevado a este proyecto a cumplir 4 años de vida.
El proyecto colectivo nació bajo las ideas del diseño sustentable enfocado al textil y sus impactos en el medio ambiente y la sociedad.
La localización física del taller llevó al colectivo a buscar un espacio físico en el perímetro Centro-Merced de la ciudad de México para trabajar estrechamente con locales y proveedores de materiales textiles. En el año 2013 estuvo relacionado con el reciclaje y medio ambiente, la reconstrucción-deconstrucción de prendas y búsqueda de nuevas técnicas para el rescate de textiles.

7. Modopactua
Es un proyecto colectivo que nace en el Centro Histórico de la Cd. de México como una propuesta de diseño, producción e investigación en diseño y textiles enfocando en el trabajo en equipo, desarrollo sustentable, reuso, innovación social y experimentación.
La relación intrínseca que existe entre el diseñador, el textil, la sociedad, la moda y el medio ambiente es objeto de análisis del colectivo que busca generar propuestas de acuerdo al panorama de México, entendiendo que la mejor manera de plantear soluciones es desde el entendimiento de la particularidad y problemática específica de cada proyecto.
Modopactua trabaja con materiales textiles como medio de expresión con fines utilitarios y organiza procesos que aporten nuevas experiencias.
El textil ha sido a través de la historia, un material que permite la exploración de nuevas formas de comunicación e integración a nivel social y ambiental pudiendo ser utilizado para ser herramienta formal y motivacional en la creación de proyectos productivos.

8.El panorama en México
Los temas de reciclaje se están haciendo presentes en cada vez más lugares a manera de talleres, cursos y ventas de materiales y productos de reuso y/o upcycling.
Las universidades e instituciones comienzan a voltear hacia el trabajo comunitario, las acciones que dejan ver la necesidad de cambios desde abajo hacia arriba (comunidad-gobierno).
Como un virus se esparce la idea de cambios a nivel medioambiental, por ser el reciclaje de los medios más cercanos a la población, por ejemplo, se generan ideas de cómo reutilizar la basura. Pero estas acciones pueden desvanecerse en el camino de las buenas intenciones si no van acompañadas de una concientización sobre la necesidad de cambios reales en el consumo y nuestra idea colectiva de la sociedad y su impacto a largo plazo.
Las consecuencias del consumo desmedido, la entrada al país de productos de bajo costo, las condiciones laborales y de vida de costureras y artesanas bajo esquemas de explotación y rezago de políticas adecuadas para la equidad y el acceso a la justicia, la sumisión del país a tecnologías que contaminan el medio ambiente e importaciones de prendas que despojan a las comunidades de identidad y de trabajo local, la exploración de nuevos materiales para la construcción de mobiliario, vestido y más, son temas que no han sido abordados en su totalidad por proyectos de diseño textil en México.
Hay un nicho muy importante y un creciente interés en estos temas por parte de ciertos sectores de la sociedad. Es la coyuntura en la que Modopactua debe integrarse.

9.  “Tejer la localidad, bordar la cartografía social“.

Juntas colaboremos para crear un mapa colectivo de oficios, talleres de producción, e iniciativas locales en colonia Centro y Guerrero relacionadas con textil y confección.

Como guía, sírvanse las siguientes preguntas:

-Qué tiene que ver la producción local de confección y textiles con la comunidad y el mejoramiento de las relaciones sociales y económicas?

-Cuál es el papel de las economías locales frente a las cadenas de producción rápida de productos provenientes de Asia?

-Dónde están los productores, los oficios, los centros de capacitación, los hacedores?.

Metodología:

-Mapeo, indagar y explorar en colaboración con los participantes.

-Trabajo vecinal.

-Trabajo con tela, tejidos, bordados, para desarrollar de manera lúdica mapas y localizar algunos puntos de partida y focos importantes en zona Centro y Guerrero.

-Desarrollar mapas para imaginar el empoderamiento de economías locales, oficios, pequeños productores y vecinos.

Objetivos:

-Construir la creación participativa, la producción y el consumo local.

-Hacer visibles las posibilidades de producción locales y retomar tradiciones barriales y oficios en el área de confección y textiles.

-Crear una plataforma colectiva para la localización de puntos de interés que favorezcan economías locales.

Los talleres de Modopactua siempre han estado encaminados a brindar una actividad práctica y una charla para compartir las experiencias y hablar de manera general sobre la relación de los textiles con la sociedad, la economía y el medio ambiente. Iniciaremos el proceso de investigación para detectar las actividades productivas de las colonias Guerrero y Centro a través de un mapeo cuya finalidad es hacer visibles oficios, talleres, centros de trabajo, de capacitación, iniciativas vecinales, etc que tengan que ver con el textil y la confección a nivel local.

10. “Nuestro futuro compartido?”
En las últimos años del siglo 20 la industria de moda se caracterizó por la producción en masa, hecha en países asiaticos bajo malas condiciones con respecto a la ley de trabajo y al daño ecológico. Muchos jóvenes diseñadores no han estado de acuerdo con este desarrollo y han empezado a marcar un contrapunto independiente.
El siglo 21 está marcado por el inicio de una nueva revolución textil y de la moda, fenómeno que se está transformando en propuestas sustentables, éticas, prácticas e inteligentes que no sólo ven por el beneficio de los diseñadores y marcas, sino también de productores, consumidores y del medio ambiente.
Con esta nueva revolución ya en el presente, el panorama de productos y servicios demanda ahora la creación de códigos y lenguajes inherentes a los textiles y los propios al área de moda.
Nuevos materiales, procesos, tecnologías y metodologías de diseño son usados como plataforma para cuestionar de manera crítica nuestro futuro compartido.
Habremos de realizar un evento participativo-colaborativo a través de la teoría y la práctica, una serie de actividades que amplíen el conocimiento, concepto, discurso y crítica de la situación del textil en el presente sin olvidar su pasado para proyectar el futuro.
Buscamos generar una plataforma de encuentro de la moda y el textil y desarrollar a partir de 3 áreas.
1. Textiles, moda y política.
2. Urbanismo, producción y procesos sociales.
3. Tecnología y avances en textiles.
En nuestro entendimiento del mundo textil, las áreas enumeradas, no son las únicas, pero las encontramos intrínsecamente relacionadas, es decir, podemos hablar de cómo los avances tecnológicos podrían beneficiar a comunidades.
Las actividades que estamos proponiendo son diversas, podemos realizarlas en conjunto o seleccionar las más destacadas y adaptarlas, o si fuera el caso, modificarlas, este es sólo un bosquejo que será detallado y expandido de acuerdo al interés y posterior selección.

11. Experimentando con textiles.
En este taller se impartirán 2 técnicas de trabajo textil como la creación de telas a partir del reuso de playeras tejidas en telar de marco e impresión textil en manta por medio de marcos en mesa.
Se organizarán equipos de trabajo dividiendo las técnicas de acuerdo a intereses de tal forma que haya una participación activa y desde los más pequeños hasta los más grandes puedan crear telas a partir de la experimentación.
Objetivo. Sensibilizar y motivar a los participantes a la autonomía de la creación mediante procesos lúdicos de diseño textil con el fin de enriquecer diversas formas de expresión y alternativas productivas mediante técnicas básicas de transformación del material, la impresión de la tela y el reuso de materiales a través del tejido.
Objetivos específicos.
-Brindar elementos básicos de creación textil mediante estrategias lúdicas que fomenten el trabajo en equipo.
-Sensibilizar al participante mediante la experiencia del diseño para promover el trabajo individual y colectivo.
-Crear una colección de trabajos que puedan mostrar diferentes formas de comunicación, de interpretación y de participación.

12. Lo urbano y el trazo textil.
Contexto: De 1970 a 1990 el área urbana metropolitana aumentó de 75 mil a 139 mil hectáreas y según el Banco Mundial para 2030, se estima que el 60% de la población mundial vivirá en áreas urbanas. Es imperante entonces vislumbrar las nuevas configuraciones urbanas y como se verá afectada su estructura.

La densificación de las ciudades, la inequidad económica y social en el campo, el cambio climático y la violencia imperante en distintos estados del país son algunas de las consecuencia de la desaparición de áreas rurales, las ciudades comienzan a expandir su territorio hacia la periferia, borrando fronteras visibles entre el campo y la ciudad, reconfigurando el orden.
La sensibilización de la población y la reflexión colectiva sobre las consecuencias del crecimiento futuro de la metrópoli de manera desmedida, podría ayudar a la conexión y revaloración de los habitantes hacia su entorno de vida y los espacios aún no absorbidos por la mancha urbana.
El textil es uno de los materiales que han acompañado al hombre desde sus orígenes y elemento primordial para la supervivencia de la especie por sus características protectoras.
Material con cualidades estéticas particulares; caída textura, color, superficie adaptable. Al principio procedente de la naturaleza; cuando el hombre utilizaba ramas para crear tejidos, fibras duras y fibras de origen animal.
Después la llegada del material sintético; la producción controlada, la expansión de la industria, los beneficios de la oferta y la demanda; una industria milenaria y poderosa con fuertes raíces sociales.
El textil ha sido a través de la historia un material noble y comunicativo que permite la exploración de nuevas formas y desarrollos. Se ha seleccionado el textil como material idóneo para representar la conexión, desconexión y reconexión de los habitantes con su ciudad.
A través de un taller llamado “Trazo Textil”, se buscó la representación de la urbanidad del Barrio de la Merced y su diversidad de contenidos a través de la realización de estampados textiles inspirados en el barrio, para lo cual se tomará como punto de partida los siguientes objetivos:
- La identidad cultural de los habitantes
- Los factores históricos
- Las condiciones socioeconómicas
- La infraestructura urbana
- Factores representativos del territorio
- Explorar la yuxtaposición de materiales y cultura.
- Capturar la estética de la vida urbana en una colección de lienzos estampados manual y experimentalmente.

- Crear experiencias sensoriales a través del textil.
- Iniciar al participante en la técnica de estampado.
13. Urbanidad y La MERCED. JARCIERIA EL HORMIGUERO/ CIUDAD DE MEXICO
La Jarciería “El hormiguero” está localizada en la esquina de la calle de Carretones y Topacio, en la colonia Centro. Se compone de 3 locales que sirven como bodega y comercializadora.
Es aquí dónde Paulina Sánchez, Sánchez y su familia se ha encargado desde 1989 de ofrecer al público productos de fibras naturales duras como cepillos, petates, sopladores, zacates, bolsas, yutes etc.
Este lugar es una salida para productos del campo fabricados a partir de diferentes agaves y fibras duras procedentes de diferentes comunidades rurales de México.
Se catalogaron 62 diferentes productos que enfrentan un declive en ventas debido a la aparición de los plásticos y la proliferación de mercancía china de menor precio en la calle de Topacio.
Quisiera presentar a la Jarciería como una ventana para ver más allá de los límites imaginarios del Centro, para conocer estos productos y mostrar una puerta que simboliza el acceso a otras relaciones de la ciudad con el campo.
*Entrevista a Paulina Sánchez, Sánchez
¿Cuando inició el negocio y con qué fin comenzó este negocio?
En 1989.
Con el fin de vender algunos artículos y hacer de esto una fuente de trabajo.
¿De dónde proviene el deseo de tener este tipo de negocio?
Soy del Edo. México y en mi pueblo se elabora mucho la escobeta de raíz, es un negocio muy común ahí y tengo familiares que se dedican a lo mismo en Edo. De México y Toluca.
¿Dónde inició la Jarcería el Hormiguero?


Aquí, en el mismo lugar, Topacio y Carretones.
¿Cuáles son los productos que más se venden?
Las escobetas de raíz y los cepillos de lechuguilla.
¿Quiénes son sus clientes más frecuentes?
Trabajadores de la industria de la construcción y algunas amas de casa.
¿Ha cambiado de giro el negocio desde que se comenzó?
Siempre he vendido lo mismo, fibras y plásticos, aunque los plásticos han disminuido la venta de los materiales naturales.
¿Cuál considera que es su mayor competencia ?
Los plastiqueros.
¿Cómo selecciona los productos que se venden dentro de la tienda?
Normalmente los productores vienen y me ofrecen sus cosas y decido en cuanto a precios.
¿Cómo han sido las ventas desde que se inició el negocio?
Al principio normal, pero han disminuido las ventas hasta ahora.
¿A qué cree usted que se deba esto?


Yo creo que a la introducción de mercancías chinas,tal vez.
¿En qué época tiene mayor venta?


Ya no hay época buena o mala, todo es igual.

14. Resistencia / Estampados

Diseño de estampado “OR” perdido entre la realidad, entre el caos y oscurantismo que al mismo tiempo dejan huecos de luz.

Fluidez e inestabilidad, resistencia y movimiento son elementos que se muestran en el  estampado, inspirados por la tarea política (más inspiración por la disidencia del artista que por el contenido y las acciones) y de experimentación plástica de Siqueiros.

15. Contra/espacio.


El textil es un material que por muchos años ha sido el vehículo de expresión de la cultura e historia de individuos, grupos, comunidades, sociedades, etc.

Este material   permite la exploración de formas de comunicación e integración a nivel artístico-cultural, social, ambiental, incluso político.


El proyecto „Contraespacio“ es el desarrollo de obra utilizando el tejido y el  estampado  para interpretar   los límites de lo físico y lo psicológico, lo público y lo íntimo, de un diario de viaje que se reproduce en textil.


Michel Foucault habla sobre los CONTRAESPACIOS como lugares fuera de todo lugar, esto es los lugares utópicos. Esos espacios que la sociedad construye y organiza como utopías situadas, los jardines, los cementerios, las prisiones, los hoteles con alberca y playa, etc.


El contraespacio que se busca construir es un lugar en el que confluyen las emociones materializadas, es en el lienzo de tela y los hilos formando una trama y una urdimbre. Estos son los que se encuentran para expresar una realidad de cambios sociales, emocionales y de comportamiento como individuo y como miembro de una sociedad.

Adaptaciones, integración y cambios en búsqueda de la pertenencia a nuevos lugares que existen y no.

Es por medio del dibujo y la fotografía que un diario de vida se ve representado en patrones de repetición para crear  estampados  en textil y en formatos de telar que hablan de migración y mujeres, el proceso de transformación ante la idealización de lugares físicos y el descubrimiento de realidades.


Un orgasmo es dibujado y repetido hasta   ser transformado en un patrón textil.

El dolor de un invierno se reproduce y se imprime en polyester.

La recomposición de los paradigmas culturales producto de la migración emocional y física se traducen en fragmentos tejidos, bordados o hilvanados.

Moves lead you by the neck like a dog
Smooth looks like you might get through this song
You shouldn't wait till the end
No two ways I just can't say why
You want to see her again?
No two ways
Get here late she'll be gone
No single utterance escapes your notice
Hanging onto words, they would carry you away
Time and other things cast away to where
You let down your guard, would she repair
Drive, insides burning, outside's blurring
Drive, road in perfect focus
Get here late she'll be gone

Fall to ground, sand and sky
It don't look much but the crazies are out tonight
Spectral shapes taking flight
It never gets old, you still cower in the dark
Twenty-two days taking their toll
Never the same, heart and soul
The real signs leave no mark
Toil and time wresting the soul
Let it out, no one
No one for miles so you just might as well lean back
Open your lungs and release all the reasons
What has sent you to mix with the snakes and the rats?
Just one more mile
Just one more mile
Just one more mile
Just one more mile
It seems too late to turn back around
The weight's too great to set down now
If time is measured in grains of sand
I've seen enough to make me want to kill a man

See there in the corner
The guy in the suit
The free and the restless
Are not one but two
I'll wait for you, will you wait for me?
Wait, don't you turn around now
If you're still, it comes to you
Stay, there's nothing like a moment
Held in your hand and say I like the way you
It's time to step through
So hang around and don't cling too
Here's time for just you
Facilitate receding ghouls
Releasing to the peace in you
Waiting still and stepping through
And stepping through
And stepping through
And stepping through

There is a moment
It don’t speak twice
It looks out for you
You close your eyes
There are some words here
The just don’t reach
The hidden beauty
Of which we speak

Look now, my sweet
Told you, worth it

There is a moment
In truth it’s blind
It takes me for you
You see the why
The whole day chasing
And nothing seen
Then on the way home
Such sweet relief

Oh the flow, yeah the flow
To capture would just rupture all
As we know
Never grasping as we fall
Smiling between
One and all it’s true

They look to the sky
The light breaking through
A sigh for me / The stillness for me
This morning for you

(The) only one who said he wanted to get back in
(The) only one who had his fun now there you are
If there’s time and if it’s mine you’ll always take it
‘Cause you’re always wasted

They woke up late, said they were multiples
Nothing faked, nothing editable
Who said they left the park, who said the wooden box was empty
All this free time makes a freak of…

They came back late, couldn’t catch their breath
Doubled once, just like hyenas
“You should have seen his face, finally the one that was caught out / finally in his place, he was caught out”
Wasted tastes like ain’t no friend of…

Grooving on the blinking of an eye
Never stopped to look around
Places everyone
Oh shit
Faces drop like pistons one by one
Smirks struggle to hold on
Finger pointing time

Makes you wonder who the joke is on


First light: amplifying the first rays of the sun seen by a small town in Iceland after months without light.  Faceted ice forms, prism like, to refract the sun.  Sculptural surfaces with seeping video projections.  Amy Burton sculptures particularly impressive with scrap plastics, hideous industrial materials in compelling combination.

She thought she would last forever… the tension between Expectation ad reality.  Speaking of failed ideals. Dystopia.  Possibly work with a circular theme, planetary allusions.  What story might we tell?
Nature, destruction, toxicity, decay, adaptation.  Collision of forces in fragile ecologies.

Distort, reverse, stretch, raise, descend, detune, liquify, synthesis, reconstruct. How to retain continuity across each section with animation and video?

Friday: invoice Zoo, Mutek, Skudi follow up, Scope.

Interpreting the quotidian through scanning technology.  Embracing imperfection and generating new forms and data. using this to create spatialised sound and video installations.  Thinking about "seeing" through technology, a mediated view, a view via our smart phones, our scanners, our web cams etc.

I don't feel like this is a collaboration any more.  Maybe this is the ending point for our current collaboration?  What kind of clips are you looking for?   What are you trying to achieve with the show/

Transhumanism; the transferring of the conscious self across mediums.  What would be the experience if our consciousness was separated from our bodies?  Audience experience: Transition from being a passive audience to active participant.  Playing with real and online selves, active/passive duality and its reversal.  The end of history means that everything happens at once.  there is no original narrative, globalisation has created a homogenous culture, when we die everyone dies.  Connectivity leads to less individualism.

Nice to hear a bit of background to the album.   I am also excited to share ideas and see what we can make together.   I love the video link you sent, I can imagine moving in that direction for several of the tracks.

We could definitely run a similar setup to what you had with Daniel - either midi or osc and an audio in.   I am assuming he created coded real time graphics for the collaboration?   I generally use a VJ software called resolume which is a clip based VJ program and interfaces well with midi or osc signals.   I don't know if you have seen the Max Cooper AV show "emergence"?   But he uses ableton triggering visuals and effects on resolume, across 2 laptops.   We could look at something like this.

I can really hear urgency and also hopefulness in your music.   The song titles seem to be more on the "dystopian" end of things but the music itself has a real optimism to it, which really interests me. (by the way I love that you have a track a called Dystopia!   possibly my favourite word/thing ever!).   There is definitely a tension between expectation and reality - "She thought she would live forever,   Just what I always wanted, An error occurred" plans that failed, ambitions that went unfulfilled.   I guess that is what dystopia is - failed ambitions, failed ideals.   I would be interested to explore this duality in some way.   Some other words related to your music for me are: dreams, eternity,   journey, yearning.

In my work I   develop imaginary spaces, scapes/worlds often in miniature scale out of everyday materials that are then transformed into something "other".   I have been getting into filming in micro, seeing the world up very very close and that seems to fit with your ideas too, which is awesome.   I like that when you are seeing something very very close it can loose its sense of scale and potentially be a vast landscape or object.   I also love working with natural processes and materials that change over time, things growing, dying, changing.
This video is a cool example: https://vimeo.com/129969254

I have experimented with time-lapse for the Nonagon show of geometric forms melting which was interesting   I was wondering if we could have something like close ups of leaves drying out/changing or changes in the maps of rainforests (showing forestry depletion).
And as you have picked out, geometry is super important in my work.   I often use geometric structures as characters or creatures and show development of character and meaning through development of the form.   This would also be in my design for your show.

   Would be great to actually talk through some of this, so if you have time to skype over the next week let me know.

Moving forward it would be useful for me to know:
1) A bit more about your travels and experiences when making the album.   what other things could be important about wild forest, animals, nature?
2)   If you had to choose a geometric form to symbolise this LP what would it be?

Technical questions:
1) what you use to perform with - for example ableton? and then to know how you structure your music for live performance - like are there layers for bass, synth/melody, drums etc
2) Video format:   Are you looking for a   single channel video at standard HD resolution that plays behind you?   Or something with any of the following like: mapped objects, led lights, multi-screen.   These all require more work for the setup of shows and could be tricky to travel with or restrictive on where you can play... but also could be cool!
3) Are you shows mostly using projectors or does the show need to translate onto LED walls too?   Makes a difference which kind of graphics work on different types of screens.

Hope to speak with you soon.   Very excited about throwing some ideas around.

Great shot of my visuals for the amazing live set from Recondite at Time Warp NYC last weekend. Thanks for the photo DanceDeep
Recondite set at Time Warp US was on point! So great to perform visuals for such a tight live set!
TONIGHT! MUTEK Mexico presents the Nonagon AV show, an audio visual project from Paula Temple and I.

Summer memories! Sonus Festival was a crazy 5 nights of techno in an idyllic Croatian setting covering 2 stages w/ Kiritan Flux. Highlights were performing for RØDHÅD, Chris Liebing and the MINUS crew Richie Hawtin, Matador and Fabio Florido. Here is a quick recap of the visuals I produced and performed at the festival.
Performing at one of my favourite clubs Le Zoo / Usine (Officiel) this Saturday with the amazing Sophie Le Meillour! Excited to see Max Cooper 's AV show Emergence again. Plus sets from La forêt and Fabian Kozelsky.
Top highlight at Sonus Festival was performing for this guy! Thanks for the amazing music RØDHÅD
Thank you Sonus Festival for an amazing week! So many highlights, but one has to be performing visuals for the MINUS crew Richie Hawtin , Matador and Fabio Florido on opening night!
Berlin! I will be performing at Tech Open Air on Wednesday in collaboration with Arielle Esther . Great range of speakers and art/music installations so come check it out.
Thank you FESTIVAL LES ARDENTES ! Such a great vibe in Liège. I hope Paula Temple and I didn't cause too much damage with our Hybrid AV show on Saturday!!
Lots of fun playing with light patterns from my video setup for this chandelier at Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) in Vegas for the closing night. 1#‎neonGarden‬


Discovering Berlin on Foot
===============================
When I visited Berlin the first few times, I got to know it by U-Bahn. Kotti, Eberswalder Straße, Rosenthaler Platz, Warschauer were my stations. I knew how to get there and how to find the places I wanted to go to, but I had no idea where they actually were located in the city. The U-Bahn was like a black box system of portals that let me emerge at specific points of an uncharted map.

When I finally moved to Berlin in April, I learnt to navigate this system of portals. I memorized the colors of its stations. I found out why changing from the U2 to the U8 at Alex takes more than the usual two minutes. I learnt to never trust a display that claims “Kurzzug hält hinten”. But in a way, the trains were still magical yellow creatures that swallowed you at point A, from where they travelled the Nether to point B, where they spit you out, back into the real world.

After some months I discovered buses. Their lines served as an alternative layer of routes, and some of their portals were hard to find. But if you found the right ones, you were suddenly able to get to the main station in mere 17 minutes, instead of the 32 it would take by U-Bahn.

Only recently I found another, almost archaic way of transportation: My feet.

I discovered that many of the every day routes I use to do by U-Bahn – office to cbase, office to co.up, Alex to le boyfriend – can actually be done on foot. True, some of these take ten minutes longer, but walking is way more relaxing and entertaining than hopping onto a crowded U-Bahn.

Besides, I really suck at navigating without maps in general and Berlin geography in particular, so learning which streets connect which places is awesome. My exclamations of “Oh wow, so _that’s_ where I am!” have become more frequent. Soon, I might be able to actually help lost tourist asking for the way.

Exploring Berlin on foot feels as if I finally discovered the underlying grid – and all the interesting things it offers: The shop windows, the street art, the smell of Kebab and weed (I call it l’odeur de Berlin). The weather, and even that much-quoted “fresh air” my parents unsuccessfully tried to have me enjoy my whole childhood.

Turns out I really enjoy walking.


When I grow up, I wanna be a Cyborg
=====================================
Recently I gave a little talk about prosthetics at Labortage. My introductory slide featured a handwritten note saying “When I grow up, I want to be a cyborg”.

In Berlin I found some fellow cyborg enthusiasts. We meet every second Monday, discussing ideas, planning workshops and talks. We had Grindhouse Wetware‘s Tim Cannon over for a talk (watch it here). Eventually we decided to do a very German thing: We founded a Verein, our own cyborg society, the Cyborgs e.V..

Why do you want to become a cyborg?
Because it’s cool, duh.
(If you want an explanation with fancier words and more elaborate ideas, you might want to ask Kevin Warwick, Ray Kurzweil or Enno.)

What inspired you to want to become a cyborg?
I’m mainly inspired by William Gibson and other cyberpunk stuff. I like Gibson’s concept of the street samurai, although, since I studied Japanese for some years, I think the name’s pretty stupid.

Molly Millions definitely is one of my role models, although she is too female for my taste. One reason for me wanting to be a cyborg simple is that I want to be badass.

I also like human-like machines like androids and replicants. According to my sister, I had a thing for TNG’s Data when I was little (“Naturally”, she added and rolled her eyes). And of course I am fascinated by the Borg, but I wouldn’t trade in my own brain for their collective consciousness. Also, their style is also a little too flashy for my taste; I’d like something more unobtrusive. (I really don’t like screaming children, and I don’t need them screaming because of me.)

Nowadays, some cyborg ideas are not sci-fi anymore; my favorite existing gadget is not Google Glass but rather Hugh Herr’s prosthetic legs. So I also want to mention him as an inspiration. He rocks.

Okay, so, according to your definition, what is a cyborg?
My definition of a cyborg is: a human whose senses and/or abilities are augmented by technology. So, according to my definition the 200.000 people with cochlear implants are cyborgs, and so are people with prosthetic limbs that enable them of more than a human leg is capable of.

Is it a goal of cyborgism to overcome the body?
Nah, I think that’s bullshit. The body is an amazing biological machine and humans probably won’t be able to develop anything near as sophisticated anytime soon. Also, my body is who I am, and while it’s awesome to customize and improve it, “overcoming” is nothing I’d want to achieve. Besides, using it is fun.

What’s your vision of the future?

I think devices will become smaller and smaller and eventually disappear. Most will be ubiquitous, some will be wearable, and probably some will be implantable.

For me, there’s no doubt these devices will be backed mainly by big corporations like Google, Apple and Microsoft, because the research, production and marketing involved will cost billions. Hackers like us can pioneer such technology, but we won’t be able to make it market-ready, and we probably don’t want to.

These corporations will own the implants and the software they’re running. Yes, this will be a problem. We are going to hack them, re-engineeer them, and jailbreak their software.

“This doesn’t sound like you got any positive vision for the future”, a journalist told me. I think it’s a realist’s vision, and I don’t think it’s that negative. I grew up knowing the benefits and drawbacks of capitalism.

What’s your worst nightmare regarding cyborgism?

In short: the dependency on it.
I am aware that most of the fancy implants and augmentations I imagine will only work as long as electricity and maintenance is provided. In case of a zombie apocalypse or just me getting stranded on an island. In such an environment, without the battery to power your artificial legs, you’re just a cripple rather than a superhuman.
That’s one reason why I’d try to enhance my existing abilities, instead of replacing them with technology. I am a software engineer, so I know about the flaws of software – and I know, that if a problem is solvable without software, it usually is the better choice.

What are your plans?
The next thing I’m going to get is an RFID implant. It’s not cyborg technology according to my definition, but it’s a start and pretty easy to do. Next up, we have plans to develop a tiny implantable device that will probably feature bluetooth and LEDs. (Join us if you want to build and hack with us.)

rins-beim-naehenSuppose Google or Apple developed a really cool prosthetic or implantable device. Would you use it?
I’ve been asked this recently, and there was a long pause, and eventually I had to admit: Yes, I probably would. I’m just too much of a gadget whore, and too less of an idealist. (Hello Google, you know who to call!)

So, you have a magnet implanted in your finger …?
Yep. You can read about it over here (in German) or here (in English).

Are you into transhumanism?
I like some transhumanist ideas, others – like, as I said, “overcoming the body” or longevity – are in my opinion, bullshit. In general, it’s a good thing transhumanism exists and these things are being discussed.

How about genetic engineering and biohacking?
Yay! \o/


Tech Meetups are awesome, but.
=================================
One of the 477 things to love about Berlin is its tech meetups. In the twelve weeks I’ve been living here now, I’ve been to a number of them: Angelhack Berlin, Codemotion, the UXcamp Europe, the github Drinkup, three instances of berlin.js, apps.js and the Angular.js meetups – and there were many more in my calendar, for example the Scala usergroup and the SoundCloud tech meetups.

I really enjoy these events – it’s awesome to get together with people, get inspired and hear what’s hot on hackernews without having to read any of it. But while listening to the talks at last week’s berlin.js, I realized that I never got past the hello world example with node.js, and I couldn’t stop thinking that I should probably hack something cool with it, rather than sit there and have no idea what everybody’s talking about. — Because, as much as I enjoy having beer with other coders, unfortunately, human knowledge can’t be transferred by osmosis.

So it’s important to keep a balance between meetups — this feel good, inspiring, social stuff and the beer — and, well, actual hacking and hands-on learning (without the beer). Too often, learning feels like doing – you’re reading or hearing about the new cool shit, but you’ve never actually touched it. You might be able to strike up a conversation the length of half a bottle of beer, because, yeah, of course you heard about WebRTC – but that’s about it.

Hanging around with smart people —these people who already know what you want to know and do what you want to do — can be really addicting and eventually become just another form of procastination. You can easily cram a dozen meetups in your calendar every month and not make any progress.

A similar thing exists with writers – of fiction, not code. Some of them love to discuss the book they’re working on. They’ll talk about it at meetups and in forums. They’ll happily tell you all about it. But when you ask them about their actual progress, you’ll see a painful expression creep into their face. Because it’s much more fun to talk about all the awesome ideas in your head than to get down to work, sitting your butt down and rewrite that damn dialogue again and again.

So, what can you I do about it?

Sit your my butt down and code, so you I have something to talk about at that next meetup.

So what’s my plan? Learn vim (and blog about it), keep up with the Coursera Startup Engingeering Course and finish my rails side project. And then, maybe, finally: Scala and Play. Along the way, see you at a meetup!


My Magnetic Implant
=========================
I’ve got a magic talent: I can tell whether my hard disk is spinning or not, just by holding my hand above it. I can also tell you whether your microwave oven is switched on, without seeing or hearing it.

Well, to be honest there’s no magic involved at all – it’s just the neodymium magnet half the size of a grain of rice that is implanted in the ring finger of my right hand.

Thanks to it, I’m able to pick up small ferromagnetic objects – needles, small screws, paperclips – and, of course, other magnets.

The practice of implanting a magnet in your body was pioneered by Finnish body modder Samppa, but the first successful implants were done around 2004 by Steve Haworth, who is considered as the inventor.

When I first heard about magnetic implants I was fascinated. Of course I wanted one. But, as my research showed, this body modification was still highly experimental at the time. So I forgot about the idea altogether, until I met a lovely girl who had a magnet implanted in one of her fingers. She told me that most of the problems of the first generation of magnetic implants had been solved (the hull of those would sometimes break, causing the magnet to corrode inside your finger), and that, while still a little experimental, the procedure was actually not that big of a deal. At least you wouldn’t risk loosing your finger or anything.

I was hooked. I had to get one. Luckily, there was a body mod artists just an hour away whom Steve Haworth had taught how to implant magnets: Arnulf at Stigmata Inc. in Cologne. So, one fine day in March, I went there to get my wetware upgrade.

The procedure of implanting the magnet was almost disappointingly easy and didn’t take long. After the anesthesia it was just one cut, putting the magnet into the finger and finally, a single stitch. The magnet is placed at the side of the tip of the ringfinger, so when you grip something you don’t apply too much pressure on the magnet directly.

Healing went very well too, and as long as I didn’t use the finger, there was no pain at all. I used the finger once, to catch my phone from falling on the floor, and yes, that did hurt – but after about two weeks, I could use the finger just like before.

After three weeks I removed the stitches. I tried not to play around with the magnet for the first seven weeks or so, because I was afraid it would move around in my finger and eventually grow out (this is said to happen sometimes).

The sensitivity takes some time. I’m still not as sensitive as other people with magnetic implants, maybe because mine is only seven months old, but maybe also due to the placement in my finger. Only about four weeks ago did I sense my spinning hard drive for the first time, and I’m still experimenting with what else I can feel. (Hit me with suggestions!)

I’ve read about people who feel the underground transformers beneath the streets, or passing electric cars. I’ve read how people develop a three-dimensional sense of electromagnetic fields. – Up to now, none of this happened for me. Maybe there are not as many nerves in the area where my implant sits, or maybe my sensitivity still needs some time to develop – I don’t know.

To my surprise, after I got the implant there were a lot of people asking “Why!?”.
It was totally natural for me that this was (and is!) an amazing thing I wanted to try: A working functional body modification? The possibility of sensing electromagnetic fields? Being able to play around with magnets with your finger? Who wouldn’t want that!? … Well, obviously there are a lot of people who wouldn’t want it, but are still very curious about the whole thing.

I can’t finish this entry without pointing out the risks: As I said, the procedure is still somewhat new; the longest time a magnetic implant has spent in somebody’s finger is around 7 years. If you get one, be prepared to have it cut out one day.

If you want to read more about it and know German, there’s magnetimplantat.de. If you don’t know German, you might want to read some of the English articles linked there. And if you have any questions – ask.


First Weeks Into Functional Programming: Lessons Learned
===========================================================
Apart from the first three chapters of Land of Lisp, the Scala Class at Coursera by Martin Odersky is my first real try at functional programming. I’m five weeks into the class and wanted to share some random insights:

Have you read Babel 17? It’s a sci-fi novel in which there’s an enemy alien race using a language enabling them to think purely logically and strategically, making them nearly invincible when it comes to strategic fighting. I was around 15 or 16 at the time I read that book, and I had actually already read Benjamin Lee Whorf’s “Language, Thought, Reality” before, because I found the paperback version in my dad’s bookshelf. Ever since I wondered if something like that was actually possible.

I usually roll my eyes when somebody mystifies something like I do now, but please bear with me here – I’m an enthusiastic functional programming padawan and the whole thing still is a little mystic to me: While learning functional programming, I’ve been reminded about Babel 17 a lot.

You start with a problem you can’t solve with the existing words of your language – yet. Then you start building the vocabulary of a language that will enable you to solve it, the functions being your words – until the solution is a very easy sentence consisting of these words. – I know I’m not the first person drawing this comparison, but experiencing it first-hand is really awesome.

Coming from an OO perspective, everything in functional programming seems more difficult at first – trying to wrap your brain around that stuff until you have a working function that solves one piece of your problem correctly … but at the end, when you combine all your fiveliners into an mindfuckingly easy and elegant solution … – wow. That moment is the fun in functional programming, and it’s why I go through the pain – and yes, at the moment it still is a lot of pain, I won’t deny that.

Another thing that occurred to me during the exercises of the class is that I wouldn’t have been able to solve any of them without tests.

When you build up your solution on top of several small functions, you need to be absolutely sure these work correctly – otherwise you’ll go straight to the inner circle of debugging hell. Tests also helped me a lot when I had to rewrite my object-oriented solutions (with mutable variables and for-each-loops) to functional ones without breaking everything. Last but not least, with tests, when I was really desperate and couldn’t figure out how to do something I could at least try some good ol’ trial and error.

By the way, I highly recommend the class – it’s a great way to learn functional programming in general, even if you’re not really interested in Scala – you’ll learn a lot about algorithms and language design.


Three Month Hobbies (featuring a Hurdy Gurdy)
===============================================
breadboardIn December, I started dabbling with electronics. When my dad heard about it, he handed me a pile of books I “might want to have a look at”. It was a huge pile, and I was somewhat hesitant to take them all with me, so, while skimming through them I said: “You know, this might be just another one of my 3-months-hobbies.”
It sounded as if it was a bad habit of mine, and when I realized what I had said, it got me thinking.

Why did I make it sound like a bad thing? What’s wrong about really getting into the stuff that sparks your interest, soaking up all the information you can get your hands on – and dropping it when you lose interest, your priorities change, or there’s a new thing on your “list of awesome things to learn about”?

Well, the answer is there’s nothing wrong with it. But it seems that’s what I’ve learnt when I was a kid.

I know, I know – it makes sense for parents. To use their words:
“What do you mean, you’re not interested in playing the Hurdy Gurdy anymore?! What about the music lessons we already paid? And all the noise we had to put up with …?” “You were all enthusiastic about it, but now that expensive robot construction kit you HAD TO HAVE is gathering dust in a corner.”
And, probably the saddest example: The pet rabbit they got you. Polly, with her fluffy white tail and her black ears.

If you were one of those kids who took up an instrument when you were young and abandoned it later, do you think you’ve failed?
Well, I was one of those kids and I used to think I failed. My attitude changed when I started to learn the accordeon last year.

I had been pondering whether to try it or not for some weeks. Only when I told my flatmates about it, did I realize this was a big deal for me. I was buzzing with enthusiasm for this instrument, but at the same time there was all this doubt and fear of failure. My flatmates frowned (and rightly so): This was just about trying something that was supposed to be fun, right? And if it wouldn’t work out, I’d just try something different, right? So what’s the drama?

Well, the drama was somewhere between my ears, and, to make a long story short, I finally got rid of it. I played the accordeon for about three months and it was awesome. Then I realized studying, learning Spanish, working part-time and learning the accordeon didn’t all fit into my schedule, so I postponed the accordeon. I’m really looking forward to learning it someday. It’s gonna be awesome, the thought makes me smile.

Some people think they are a failure, and they will always find reasons to reconfirm this self-concept. And true, I was that kind of person for some time. I’m not anymore – or at least I’m trying hard not to be :).

So that’s why I invented Three Month Hobbies (TM). You don’t have to stick with them, you’re not allowed to feel guilty when you give them up. You don’t have to become a renowned, world-class hurdy gurdist – just have some fun.

P.S.: And no, I’ve never played a Hurdy Gurdy. But it’s a pretty awesome instrument. I had the neglected pet rabbit, though. :(

P.P.S.: My Three Month Hobbies of 2012 also include Origami and model railways. I’m curious what this year’s will be.


Dear Mr. Acks,

thank you for your email. - The series sounds really interesting!

There is indeed a meetup of cyborgs in Berlin, but it’s more about intellectual discussions than about grinding (see here for the Mission Statement: https://cyborgs.cc/?page_id=9, maybe Google Translate can help). The founder is Enno Park, who wears a Cochlea Implant and sees himself as a cyborg (mail@ennopark.de).

Because I rather wanted to build (and implant!) things than talk, I created a little cyborg tinkering group. We started with small fun projects like an electronic safe that can be opened with an implanted RFID chip (bad quality video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSl-Ly1hCX4 ) and stuff to use our magnetic implants with, like a device that you hold in your hand that generates a different electromagnetic field depending on the direction you point it to, basically a sensible compass.

Being pretty dissatisfied with the status quo of implantables, we also wanted to build implants, of course. We actually talked to Finnish body mod artist Samppa (who is one of the “inventors” of magnetc implants, together with Steve Haworth) and he offered us his help.

Long story short: We never got far. It’s frustrating to see what technology is already available for medical use (both for humans and other animals), while we grinders are still way behind, struggling with the most basic things like power supply. We just never got past the battery problem and gave up (for now).

We’re in sporadic contact with Tim Cannon of Grindhouse Wetware, and I’m really interested in their Northstar and would love to have it implanted. But other than that, I’m still pretty much a wannabe cyborg with two magnets and two RFID chips.

In the meantime, my tinkering projects developed into a hardware startup that I try to keep alive beside my regular day job, so sadly I’ve not really had the time to do many cyborg-y things. At the moment I’m basically waiting for somebody else to develop something awesome – pretty sure I’d be one of the first to implant it. (So if you know of anything besides Grindhouse, please let me know!)

About the grinder scene in Berlin, I don’t really think there is one, at least not that I know of. I can of course connect you to the people (or cyborgs? :) ) of Cyborgs e.V., but I’m afraid there’s not much that you won’t find in the states.

Hope I could help,
best,

Rin


Hey Piotr,

thank you for your mail.

It’s awesome to have an experienced speaker as a mentor. (btw, congrats on speaking at Baruco, that will probably be awesome, and say hello to Jojo :).) – And yep, of course I remember the mechanical keyboard talk! Do you give a talk this year too?

I’m not exactly a chronic procrastinator (I actually finished my thesis with some days left and no allnighters, which was probably reasonable, but, like a lot of reasonable things, it also felt kinda boring). Still, I need a kick up the backside once in a while, so it would be great if we could just exchange status updates – that will already help a lot :).

At the moment I have to prepare a talk for the local Ruby user group, but at least I created a repo (and added you as a collaborator so you can see what’s going on).

My basic idea is building a game from the ground up (which is, I think, easy enough with Gosu), without boring people with explanations about the framework. So I probably won’t need a lot of slides. So instead of polishing my slides I can concentrate on practicing the live coding :).

The game is probably going to be a side scroller with a twist. First idea: Make the enemies/obstacles move in the same speed as the player, so it gets harder when you move fast, and when you move slower it feels as if you slow down time. – Of course it would be awesome if the game was actually fun to play and also looked cool, but … let’s see what I get done in the coming three weeks :).

cheers and thanks for your help!

Ruby coder and wannabe cyborg. Ambassador for decent tea and Mars exploration. Internauta de Corazón. My grandma taught me BASIC, but I never learnt to whistle.
Let's build a game with Ruby
Friday night, 1 am. You're down to the last third of your Augustiner and you're frustrated.

For over an hour you've been browsing that folder of unfinished Ruby side projects of yours, realizing that almost all of them are dry CRUD applications. Meanwhile, some of the cool kids in your twitter timeline keep posting their Ludum Dare submissions.

You cannot help but wonder if you should have learnt something other than Ruby.

For a second you even ponder trading in its elegance for some robust C++.

DON'T PANIC. Stop that XCode download. There's hope: Gosu is a Ruby library providing basic building blocks for game development like a window with a main loop, sound samples, gamepad input etc.

And it's so simple that you can even start developing your first game that same night, even after another beer.*

Let me walk you through building a 2D game with Gosu from the first line of code to a playable game.

* [This talk will, of course, neither advocate nor support coding under the influence of alcohol.]


(THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHERS)
// Building simulations beyond the if/thens to the how so’s. 


> This, That, and the Others
I remember it so clearly – driving across the desert on my way to California. The windows are rolled down, allowing the wind to continue its pathway across rather than interrupting to go up and around my small, blue, Toyota SR5 (1984). Up ahead, the first dots of the city begin to add a shine along the horizon – marking the transition from (mostly) vast open expanses of land into modern urban civilization. Once in the city, the transition continues. As we get closer, what appears to be a mass blur of luminescence reveals itself as individual glowing orbs belonging to a city grid. Closer still and we stop at just one traffic light. Beyond it, we can see the subsequent lineup: each taking its turn to move from a dull red to green, and so on, and so on, and so on... It is, in a way, a familiar exercise in everyday powers of ten.1 We’re exposed daily to a dense network of overlapping systems: roadways cutting across flat desert expanses, the domino effect of traffic lights, or airplanes lining up like marathon runners in the changing room before their next big race*. 


It’s hard to imagine a time before such colonization–like the Arctic before the race for exploration began. Our modern environment bears the fruits of a designed world built upon previous technological eras: the extension of information networks established by an Information Age, integrated throughout the backbone of the Industrial Period which came before it. The resulting is a highly structured networked urban environment which extends far beyond the screen: the grid of city streets, the network of traffic lights, the flow of airplane traffic overhead.


The structure is so ubiquitous, that it’s almost unintelligible: media-rich cityscapes and websites now so commonly experienced that we often overlook not only their existence, but that of the underlying creative tools with which we designed them (likely an ever-growing variety of urban planning and media design tools and an equivalent to Dreamweaver, respectively). These tools, in turn, have been designed built upon other models of organizing information, as is reflected in their organizational structure (whether it be paths, landmarks, and structures2 ; or lists, indexes, and directories3 ). 


With the prediction of a not-so-distant future affecting both macro (by 2050, 75% of the world’s population will be living in cities4 ) and micro (Moore’s law predicts a long-term trend of infinitely decreasing technological size matched by increasing processing power5 ) scales, the future looks to be even more structured. Situated within the context of what looks to be an increasingly structured urban future, This, That, and the Others examines the paradox of mediating infinitely subjective experiences through finite logic-based structures. The promise of an increasing hybrid between digital and physical space asks for a redefinition of common understandings within an Information Age such as information itself and related algorithmic processes. 
This paper reviews the process of exploration which helped form the series of methodologies and programs which make up the thesis project,This, That, and the Others: Unconditional Programming beyond the “if/thens” to the “how so’s”. Inspired by theories which suggest that the next stage of technological advancement might champion increasingly modular structures, This, That, and the Others builds upon the observation of current trends for semantic exploration (practiced mainly throughout artistic fields of practice) across the many finite micro structures which underly macro scales. The final projects take shape as speculative scenarios, or programs, executed using the affordances of low-barrier design tools. The implications of such a methodology are inherent to each program, suggesting considerations for more modular structural engineering, as well as the facilitation of complex user experience throughout techno-urban networks. The 5 steps of a method for Unconditional Programming suggest the possibility for facilitating the ongoing evolution of conditional relationships: 1/5: Expand, 2/5: Build, 3/5: Run. 4/5: Array, 5/5: Data. Low barrier tools assist in these explorations, using the affordances of existing technologies to imagine the potential across physical space–“beyond the if/thens to the how so’s”. Given the infinity of potential combinations, and our subjective relational understandings, this Post-Information Age will ask for us to search through our mass structured world and find information as it is meaningful to us.


> Urban Information and Human Processing
The evidence of information in an urban context, for example, is pervasive: apartment numbers, postal codes, detour routes (the list goes on)*. The complex layering of urban systems (both digital and physical, designed and naturally occurring) calls for a broader definition of terms usually isolated to digital space. The subsequent production, aggregation, and analysis of mass quantities of “urban information” is mediated through the constant filtering of information ordering structures, or what could be considered algorithmic codes.6 These algorithms are not necessarily digitally mediated, they might be evidence of other established information structures, such as the organization of beer into neatly packaged assortments of either 6 or 12 - packs or a case of 24. 


Other algorithmic processes such as those used to conduct the flow of traffic are highly networked; built upon the backbone of industrial infrastructures which were later adapted with information networks.7 Designed to create order within disorder, the underlying linear logic of algorithmic codes inherently objectifies the subjective. They set up rules to search through and to generalize information into categories so as to find that which can be logically defined to either fit a defined rule, or to stand outside of it.8 The success of these logical algorithms lies in their objectivity, defining processes of representation which ultimately communicate machine understandings through 0s and 1s.9 In contrast, human logic is highly subjective – the culmination of multiple qualitative experiences subject not to one set logic, but rather to rationale inherent within our individual understandings. Just as algorithms are informed by various “programming languages” and their respective syntaxes, we facilitate our understandings through natural language(s), containing our own biases in a daily process of information processing.10 
One person’s tendency, for example, might be to read a building as aesthetically beautiful; while another might view it as “too modern”. Our biases are informed by our experiences. In effect, the schemas by which we have learned to organize our procedural human understandings inform rules by which we aggregate data, categorize like or unlike things, and translate everyday stimuli into informed conclusions.11 The code, for example, supporting a network of traffic lights does not notice if someone is in a rush; but rather if someone is, or isn’t present.* A pedestrian, on the other hand, might inform multiple conclusions from their observations. They may infer, for example, that a woman tapping nervously on her steering wheel could mean that she is late, or that she is enjoying dancing to her music. 




> The Strength of Human Rationale
The strength of our logic lives within this subjective qualitative reasoning: the speculative, the inexpressible, the intuitive, and the narrative. This is, in essence, that which can more easily be written about or illustrated. The written works of urban novelists China Miéville or Italo Calvino demonstrate the full potential of their freedom in exploring the urban environment. In his novel, The Scar, Miéville describes a floating ocean city constructed from the amalgamation of ships:


“They were built up, topped with structure, styles and materials shoved together
from a hundred histories and aesthetics into a compound architecture. Centuries-old
pagodas tottered on the decks of ancient oarships, and cement monoliths rose like extra
smokestacks on paddlers stolen from southern seas. The streets between the buildings
were tight...Decktop houses were cracked and strained from the boats’ constant motion.”12


In order to explore information processing inherent within the everyday experience, I began a series of exercises which I called “humans writing programs”. Participants were asked to respond to a variety of prompts such as “write a story of a recent interesting experience in code”, or, “write a list of anything”*. The prompts were written as lists of information on simple lined notebook paper. I reminded participants to separate ideas as they saw fit and to number each line as they progressed.


The ongoing work titled Sorted Books by Nina Katchadourian illustrates the nature of procedural human understandings informing the categorization of like things. She collects a manual assortment of books gathered from various libraries:


“...ranging form private homes to specialized public book collections...[where] the process is the same in every case: culling through a collection of books, pulling particular titles, and eventually grouping the books into clusters so that the titles can be read in sequence, from top to bottom*. Taken as a whole, the clusters from each sorting aim to examine that particular library’s focus, idiosyncrasies, and inconsistencies — a cross-section of that library’s holdings.”13


With the “algorithm” she has identified (based on her own interpretation of sequence and categorization), this piece makes a lovely point of the strength of human intelligence over computer intelligence.


> Lost in Translation
The freedom of intuitive expression through natural language doesn’t quite translate to machines. They first ask for a breakdown of information, often which requires the construction of multiple algorithms to parse through machine understandings.14 A recent workshop with the graphic design studio Lust demonstrated this process.15 Given the task of using Processing to develop a data visualization from the transcripts of a Republican debate, I decided to aggregate the information by assigning visual values to represent how “family-friendly” the candidates are*. This required the generation of multiple supporting information structures, including: the parsing of debate data into a spread sheet, the construction of functions to assign different classes to different types of information, and accessing keyword text files of words assigned with negative or positive values.


The co-founder of Area/Code, Kevin Slavin, describes how this kind of parsing of data affects the natural process of human expression: 


“ You’re no longer writing to communicate clearly with a human. You’re writing to
be as clear as possible to Google search algorithms. It’s creating a kind of writing
that denigrates language. But, it makes perfect sense; with SEO-driven sites, their
audience isn’t an idealized human reader, it’s an idealized machine reader — which has
quantitative criteria*. [In this search-driven landscape, we’re adapting to] an algorithmic
approach to English... It’s a way to parse language precisely, in unambiguous terms,
without the subtleties and vagaries of genuine human speech.”16




Donna Haraway would describe this as the establishment of increasingly cyborg systems, and the resulting production of outsider figures. Outsiders are those who haven’t met the designed system of built society, and who in effect (either by choice or circumstance of legibility, etc.), are left to either adapt within, or flee outside.17 Inspired by the desire to flee from what he considered to be the “over-civilization” of industrial society, Henry David Thoreau escaped to find refuge on the banks of Walden Pond in a two year experiment of simple living.18 It might be difficult to envision the possibility for this kind of refuge in the future, where the prevalence of infinitely expanding structure may not allow for entire escape. This is true on a macro scale with the prediction that by 2050, 75% of the world’s population will be living in cities.19 Moore’s law outlines the probability that this might be true on the micro scale as well, suggesting a future of ubiquitous embedded technologies which are likely to be invisible to the human eye.20 
This question seems especially relevant now given what is happening with the Occupy movement, and corresponding calls to modernize and re-evaluate the finite and broken codes of mass-systems supporting economics, politics, and education.21


Given the potential unlikelihood of entire escape, This, That, and the Others envisions the possibility of adapting infinitely subjective interpretations within existing finite structures. Writers like Gertrude Stein and Anaïs Nin are two examples of those who adapted the most basic technology of their time – the written language – to allow for intuitive human expression.22 The result of their experimentations were great – taking creative liberties to extend the traditional one-to-one relationship between syntax and semantics. Stein’s words, for example, suggested the subjectivity of relationships across multiple viewpoints.23 Does the inherently logical structure of our current algorithmic codes prohibit necessary intuitive exploration and subjective adaptation as practiced by the likes of Gertrude Stein with natural language? With the prediction of an increasingly structured future urban environment, what are some possible avenues for adapting the finite nature of algorithms to allow for the integration of infinitely subjective perspectives?


Inspired by my own observation of a fast-evolving urban structure within my own hometown of Pittsburgh, I wrote a manifesto entitled 38 Lines: A Dreamer’s Manifesto in Code*. I attempted to capture my desire for fulfilling the exploratory intuition which I see in myself as well as other Pittsburgh transients who have migrated east from their previous homes (in successfully developing places like Portland) after hearing word of the “potential” in underdeveloped cities like Pittsburgh.24 Throughout this exercise, I borrowed from my own limited understanding of the conditional programming language, exploring the potential for intuitive expression within the constraint of “fixed” systems such as the syntax of “If’s” and “Then’s. I found refuge in the snippets of natural language storytelling possible within comments beneath the coded syntax.


Oh, the irony: within the infinite potential of algorithmic structures, we are contained to finite structures of practice. In effect, this restricts contribution of various perspectives to those insiders who are already fluent. A future of increasing urban structure is paired with an increase in diversity.25 As such, it will be increasingly important to continue to explore the full potential of our technologies: the aggregation of large amounts of information, and the integration of human strengths for intuitive exploration and infinite semantic interpretations. 




> Possibilities within a Post-Information Culture
In their new book Collage Culture, essays by Aaron Rose and Mandy Kahn consider how this kind of subjective interpretation might be exactly where we can find ourselves as result of an information culture in which we feel overwhelmed with abundance. They suggest that we create by collaging, or re-editing where “[our] signatures [are] embedded in ... subtle acts of choice” rather than “creating art from scratch.” The collages of Brian Roettinger which sit in between the two author’s essays translate a combination of 25 compositional rules into a series of 16 compositions*.26 


RULES FOR COMPOSITION 1–10
1 — Use 20%, 50%, 60%, or 70% white space
2 — All elements must touch each other
3 — Use one image multiple times, at varying scales
4 — Use a white background
5 — Compose twelve lines, all of different lengths and widths
6 — Fill the background with a pattern
7 — Fill the background with an image
8 — Include a line between one and eight points in thickness
9 — Scale image at 200%
10 — Scale image at 20%


This trend for collaging would seem evident to the avid internet surfer who has first-hand witness: a handful of “meme” related sites27, the color-based search site False Arms28*, or doppelgänger personalities on Facebook.29 How might this collage mentality translate beyond momentary trends, and offer possibilities for integrating wider perspectives within finite algorithmic structures?


Consider the common example of pattern recognition within computer terminology:  x == y (non-coders might be more familiar with the mathematical syntax “x=y”)30. Its function is to search for the “equivalency” of two things. In a world of ubiquitous information, there is potential for multiple semantic relationships while lie beyond the limitations of finite rule sets which assign a quality x as identical to a variable y. The possibilities suggest the promise of exploring infinite opportunities for pattern recognition, subject to interpretation on part of the viewer. For example, I might say an apple == an orange (as they are both fruit), while someone else might say an apple == lipstick (if seen as both red in the mind of the interpreter).


Playing off of the familiar game of Memory, I developed “Pick a match, Any match”*, as a way to explore an exercise where “x=y, but what are ‘x’ and ‘y’?”. This exercise acts as a proof of concept of the potential for applying human processing power to filter through mass groups of information within a Post-Information Age. In exploring new connections, we are likely to borrow from other structures. We could borrow, for example, literary terms such as metaphors and idioms to rationalize interpretations of foreign relationships between a deer and lamppost (“a deer in headlights”*) or a clock and a wing (“time flies”*).


In an urban environment, stimuli occurs naturally in the information transmitted throughout everyday experience. The experience of seeing the night sky demonstrates the subjectivity inherent in an experience sure to occur at the intersection of multiple overlapping designed and “natural” systems. Natural forces of nature culminate in what we perceive to be twinkling stars, and are layered with the effects of pollution affecting visibility; all of which are witnessed by one viewer from one point in space (given the surrounding environment facilitates the view), and their internal and external conditions (they may or may not consider a plane to be part of a night sky). 


Guided by a curiosity of how complex human experience might translate back into executable, logic-based code, I met with programmer Casey Anderson and brought with me my pile of jumbled observational system “glitches” I had compiled into a “Not Yet Catalogue”*. I pulled one out of the pile and asked him to help me develop a code for “the experience of seeing a bird and a plane at the same time”*. I recorded him speaking, as he drew the sketch below*. 


A discussion in coding quickly turned to a philosophical discussion. It became clear that there were many ways to interpret this experience (any of which would result in other aspects getting lost in translation). We explored multiple options of how to code the experience:


<search for 2 things which:
share the same function, but different parameters
// both an airplane and a bird fly, but one is natural and the other is mechanical
>
or
share the same function and the same parameters, but different variables
// both an airplane and a bird fly in the sky, but one is slow and rhythmic and the other
comparatively fast and steady multiple iterations.


In their project Sealand, Metahaven considers their role as design detectives facilitating a “form of contemporary myth-making” which is not:


“[based] on the a priori truths about the organizations that conventionally form the starting point for corporate identity projects [but rather to uncover the] ... epic story about Sealand ... embracing an infinite amount of possible Sealand definitions and stories [as searched through google search and everyday objects]*, multiplying and re-ordering them by self-defined principles into an identity of unprecedented richness.”31


> What is the potential for facilitating a rich re-ordering of post-information semantics on an urban scale? 


Although this might sound like an unrealistic stretch of the imagination, algorithms are increasingly driving not only our digital information structures, but information networks throughout the systems of our built environment: our cars, our homes, our neighborhoods, and our cities.32 I looked to Christopher Alexander’s Pattern Language (1977) for inspiration. Influenced by the developing understanding of network structure (which evolved as a way to discuss computer programming and design), A Pattern Language breaks down the complexity of a built environment into 253 patterns, which together form a “pattern language”*.  Alexander’s motivations were to extend the ability for coding and decoding the built environment beyond the professional realm, to ordinary people.33


> Reverse Engineering Urban Experience
In order to explore the potential for a kind of matrix of “code-able” understandings within existing systems (so as to allow for their adaptation and the exploration of their execution), I adapted the traditional method of engineering development. Engineering is described as the application of “scientific, mathematical, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to design and build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes.”34 I borrowed instead from reverse engineering, a process (originally used for military methods) which allows for the ability “to deduce design decisions from end products with little or no additional knowledge about the procedures involved in the original production...[and]...without using or simply duplicating the original.”35  


The proposed method started with end experiences within everyday urban living, using observation and secondary research to decode them into a kind of “view source” for higher literacy and editing. The resulting were a set of pseudo-algorithmic blueprints or experience maps which identified their constituent variables and qualifying parameters with x’s and y’s*. The aim was to suggest the potential for semantic reordering before executing back into the urban context.


Currently, reverse engineering is used for many applications: generating computer-aided designs (CAD), protein simulations in nanotechnology, and across a wide array of other computer-aided simulations.36 This reverse engineering process was applied across a loose definition of algorithmic codes within urban experiences, including: frameworks guiding aesthetic decisions such as the arrangement of chairs in a dentist waiting room, or the alignment of trees within landscape design*; highly designed networks such as the flow of airplane traffic*; even predictable moments of seeming serendipity such as a balloon caught on a telephone wire*. 


Some were executed by coding a quick interpretation in Processing, exploring the translation of cross-relational human “information” back into executable code*. As I progressed with the experiments, I considered further inquiry of the implications of executing semantic re-orderings within open-source engineering processes. 


> Could simulation environments help gain understanding regarding the resulting implications of adaptable engineering on aesthetics and culture?  


The following example simulating a future algorithm for defining flags*, for instance, suggests how a complex algorithm containing smaller dynamic constituent components might reflect influence on the cultural identity of its corresponding countries.


> How is this different than customization? 


Some might argue that this kind of integration of individual perspectives within systematic processes is already being practiced as customization. Customization, however, maintains the abstraction of the initial input. It is often interpreted and translated by a skilled worker, or rule-based algorithmic process which simply allows higher variability within the end product.37 By comparison, a process of adapted reverse-engineering processes could consider the realization of “everyone as a maker”.38 The potential of individual interpretive coding processes could reveal participants’ corresponding influences, biases (as they may borrow from various choice formats for structuring information) and choices of coding “languages” (this means writers writing in gmail as well as coders writing in processing, etc.).


In the following experiment, I asked my brother (a biophysicist familiar with coding proteins using Python) to code his interpretation of a traffic light. Asked to document his process within the comments, the resulting visualization demonstrates the inherent biases and choices within his chosen coding practices: “a set of four traffic lights, each set to display a default color of red, unless the keys a,s,d, or f are pressed...*”


> What other methods might be employed next to integrate observations of a post-information age or to imagine speculations of a near future influenced by post-information mentality, and the effects as executed across a highly structured urban context?


The following experiments will continue to apply a process of reverse engineering to decode observations of modern urban experience. The resulting will inform a kind of storytelling through the generation of “pseudo-code” scripts*, and the playing out of film scenarios*.


Firms use a combination of debt and equity to finance their assets. The proportion of debt and equity determines a whole hierarchy of fixed claims on assets and earnings, with premiums paid for different levels of risk. “How do firms choose their capital structures?” Debt will oblige the firm to make contractual fixed interest payments in each period to the debt-holders, where equity allocates claims on the free cash to equity. Enterprises can choose from a various range of financial instruments to finance its investment. Debt can be obtained by issuing bond or by taking a loan from a bank either short or long term. Hybrid instruments, such as convertibles combine characteristics of debt and equity. Equity might have the form of common or preferred stock. Capital structure ratios describe the debt level in relation to the value of the enterprise, in terms of market or book value. The actual corporate debt ratio is defined as the value of debt (D) divided by the value of debt and Equity (E): In the last decades a large amount of empirical research examining the determinants of capital structure has been done, making the debt to equity ratio the dependant variable and bringing more clarity into the capital structure puzzle. “We now understand the most the important departures from the Modigliani and Miller assumptions that make capital structure relevant to a firm’s value.” Rajan and Zingales (1995), examining leverage in the G-7 countries, see capital structure influenced by country specific factors, on one side. Corporate financing decisions depend on institutional differences, like the tax and bankruptcy code, the meaning of corporate control, the historical role played by banks and security markets and inflation. On the other side they see leverage correlated with firm specific factors, such as growth opportunities and the expected cost of financial. They use size as a proxy for the probability of default and use the market to book ratio as proxy for growth opportunities. Titman and Wessels (1988) use six measures of financial leverage. They are long term, short term and convertible debt divided by market and book ratio. Harris and Raviv (1991) mention that “leverage increases with fixed assets, profitability and firm size and decreases with volatility, advertising expenditure, the probability of bankruptcy and uniqueness of the product.” They give an overview about models explaining capital structure. One argumentation string is based on agency costs and sees conflicts between equity holders and managers or conflicts between equity and debt-holders as determining the financing behavior of firms. Models based on asymmetric information describe firms following a Pecking Order, managers using debt to signal to the market or firms timing debt or equity issues to the market conditions. All models on capital structure rely on the assumptions of Modigliani and Miller, describing the value of a firm as a function of its expected cash flows. The modern theory of capital structure has its roots in the framework delivered by the path breaking article of Modigliani and Miller in 1958. “What is the "cost of capital" to a firm in a world in which funds are used to acquire assets whose yields are uncertain; and in which capital can be obtained by many different media, ranging from pure debt instruments, representing money-fixed claims, to pure equity issues, giving holders only the right to a pro-rata share in the uncertain venture?” The question raised by Modigliani and Miller in 1958 on the cost of capital, has not lost its relevance. The M&M capital structure irrelevance proposition has set the theoretical framework for modern corporate finance research and empirical analysis. Furthermore, the M&M propositions have led to advanced theoretical models of capital structure, leading to both clarity and controversy. Indeed, many economic researchers have followed M&M´s path, developing various theories and models to specify the determinants of capital structure. The question on whether there is an optimal capital structure remains an important one barred with endogenous and exogenous convolutions that suggest interrelationships among existing models as well as correlations between a general model formulation and resulting large and complex structures; the emergence of global economical structures further impacting upon the topic’s complexity.  “That is, the average cost of capital, to any firm is completely independent of its capital structure and is equal to the capitalization rate of a pure equity stream of its class.”  The fundamental idea of M&M was to characterize a firm as a production function of its capital streams and differentiate firms with regard to risk classes. They pointed out under which conditions capital structure is irrelevant to the value of a firm and that the market value of a firm should depend on its expected capital streams. 30 years after their influential paper, Merton Miller admits: “Showing what doesn´t matter can also show by implication what does.” The original M&M propositions are valid under these conditions: A perfect capital market allows all informed participants to lend and borrow money with the same interest rate. Investors and firms have equal access to financial markets. As a result, investors can determine leverage according to their needs. There are no transaction costs.  In a frictionless world, a firm would be indifferent in issuing securities as equity or debt. The absence of bankruptcy costs. No asymmetric information and no agency costs, firms act in the best interest of its shareholders. Firms can be divided into "equivalent return" classes. This implies that shares within the same class differ by a scale factor and the ratio of the return to the expected return is identical for all shares in the class and the share price is proportional to its expected return. No tax subsidies. Modigliani and Miller start with the assumption, that a firm has a specified set of expected cash flows and capital structure decisions in order to finance its assets and divide up the cash flows among investors. A firm would invest in a physical asset if it increases the net profit of the owners of the firm, under the condition that the yield of the asset exceeds the rate of interest. Furthermore, an asset should be acquired, if it adds more to the market value of the firm than its costs and increases the value of equity. The value it creates can be defined by capitalizing the stream it generates at the market rate of interest. The existence of uncertainty superimposes a risk discount to be subtracted from the expected yield or a risk premium to be added to the market rate of interest. “Because firms may have different proportions of debt in their capital structure … the shares will be subject to different degrees of financial risk or "leverage" and hence they will no longer be perfect substitutes for one another.” In the Proof of Proposition I by M&M,  denotes the market price of a share of company j.  denotes the expected return realized by the company. Therefore,  is the expected return per share. In a first step, a factor of proportionality is introduced to the model. denotes the expected rate of return of equity for all firms j in class k under all equity financing. To prove the first proposition,  is introduced to describe the market value of debt and  denotes the market value of equity. Proposition I now asserts that the value of a company can be defined equally by the sum of market value of equity and debt or by capitalizing its expected return at its appropriate rate. This means that the market value of any firm is independent of its capital structure. The value of a firm therefore will be determined by capitalizing its expected return by the appropriate rate of return in its class. “That is, the average cost of capital, to any firm is completely independent of its capital structure and is equal to the capitalization rate of a pure equity stream of its class.”  can be stated as the firms average cost of capital, which is the ratio of its expected return to the market value of all its securities. To establish their proposition, they show that arbitrage opportunities arise if the relation (2) or (3) does not hold. In the example, there are two companies. One is unlevered, while the other one has an amount of debt. Both companies have the same return X. An Investor is holding s2 dollars worth of the shares of company 2. The return from his portfolio is denoted , which will be a fraction  on the return X, less interest charge. Now, the investor sells his fraction  of shares of  and takes a bank loan   pledging his securities of new shares of  as collateral. So he gets  shares of . Comparing (4) to (5), we see that as long as we have  we must have. M&M conclude therefore, that levered companies cannot command a premium over unlevered companies, because investors could put the equivalent leverage in their portfolio by taking a personal credit. Since arbitrage will prevent  from being larger than, M&M conclude that in equilibrium we must have , as stated in Proposition I. From proposition I M&M derive the following proposition II concerning the rate of return on common stock in companies whose capital structure includes some debt: the expected rate of return or yield, i, on the stock of any company j belonging to the kth class is a linear function of leverage as follows: “That is, the expected yield of a share of stock is equal to the appropriate capitalization rate  for a pure equity stream in the class, plus a premium related to financial risk equal to the debt-to-equity ratio times the spread between and r.” Under the assumption that a firm is acting in the best interest of its shareholders, it will exploit investment opportunities if the rate of return of the investment is larger than its average
 cost of capital. Every project with a positive NPV, discounted by the weighted average cost of capital will be undertaken by the firm. In 1963, M&M admitted that, taking corporate income taxes into account, the debt to equity ratio might affect the market value of a company: “The market values of firms in each class must be proportional in equilibrium to their expected returns net of taxes (that is, to the sum of the interest paid and expected net stockholder income).” Taking the existence of tax payments into account, it can be shown that "arbitrage" will make values within any class a function of the tax rate and the degree of leverage. Instead of they introduce  as the rate at which the markets capitalize the expected returns and the tax rate. The value of a levered firm, therefore, will be  plus the value of interest tax shields. We see that the firm value is increasing with the corporate debt level. The value of the company would be maximized under all debt financing. Introducing tax effects, M&M define required rate of return on equity: The tax corrected version predicts a smaller increase of the risk premium with higher leverage as a matter of tax deductibility of interest payments. After introducing a tax component, M&M derived: Taking tax benefits of debt payments into account the weighted average cost of a firm is a decreasing function of its debt to equity ratio. is the return on equity for the unlevered firm and the market value of the unlevered firm. The decrease of WACC with leverage shows that the value of a firm is not independent of the debt/equity division in the capital structure, due to the deductibility of interest. A decrease in the weighted average cost of capital would increase free cash to the firm and therefore the market value of equity. “The optimal capital structure might be all debt.” Companies with too low debt levels and high bond ratings were leaving too much money on the table in form of unnecessary corporate income tax payments. The prevailing academic idea by the mid 70´s was that the optimal capital structure involves balancing the tax advantage of debt against the present value of bankruptcy costs. Miller introduced a model showing that the tax advantage of debt financing might be offset under certain conditions by the tax disadvantage of interest income from debt at a personal tax level. The following models introduced various leverage related costs with explanatory power to determine optimal capital structure. Cost of financial distress, agency costs and non debt tax shields became subject to further theoretical approaches, also flexibility to finance future investments became an issue. “A firm's optimal debt ratio is usually viewed as determined by a tradeoff of the costs and benefits of borrowing, holding the firm's assets and investment plans constant. The firm is portrayed as balancing the value of interest tax shields against various costs of bankruptcy or financial embarrassment.” According to Myers (1984), a firm that follows the trade-off theory sets a target debt-to-value ratio and then gradually moves towards the target, which is determined by balancing debt tax shields against costs of bankruptcy. A firm´s optimal capital structure is determined by a tradeoff of costs and benefits of its debt ratio. The theory says that firms substitute debt for equity or equity for debt until the value of the enterprise is maximized and the target ratio is reached. The fact that actual debt ratios, observed by empirical studies, show wide variation could possibly be explained by adjustment costs. Random events might bump them away from the optimum and force companies into long excursions away from their optimal ratio. On the other hand, if adjustment costs are small and firms would be close to their optimums, differences in risk and other variables must be explanatory for the variations in capital structure of firms. The prevailing academic view that the optimal capital structure balanced the tax advantage of debt against the present value of bankruptcy costs was challenged by Miller (1977), questioning the relevance of bankruptcy costs. Comparing bankruptcy costs to tax savings on interest payment seems to be relatively small. He delivers the argument that equity holders can benefit from leverage by taking personal taxation into account. Where is the corporate tax rate, the personal income tax rate applicable to income from common stock and the personal tax rate on income from bond, B is the market value of the levered companies debt. When the tax rate on income from shares is less than the personal tax rate on income from bonds, the gain from leverage will be smaller because the before tax return on taxable bonds has to be higher to offset this disadvantage. “Any situation in which the owners of corporations could increase their wealth by substituting debt for equity (or vice versa) would be incompatible with market equilibrium. Their attempts to exploit these opportunities would lead, in a world with progressive income taxes, to changes in the yields on stocks and bonds and in their ownership patterns. These changes, in turn, restore the equilibrium and remove the incentives to issue more debt, even without invoking bankruptcy costs or lending costs as a ´deus ex machina´.” Since then new models were developed to reconcile Miller´s model with the balancing theory of optimal capital structure. The main finding being that there are significant leverage related costs, such as bankruptcy costs, agency costs of debt and loss of non debt shields. De Angelo and Masulis (1979) follow thåe path of taking personal taxation into account and extent Miller´s analysis. They find that Miller´s irrelevancy theorem is extremely sensitive to realistic and simple modifications in the corporate tax code: “Specifically, the existence of non-debt corporate tax shields such as depreciation deductions or investment tax credits is sufficient to overturn the leverage irrelevancy theorem.” Their model implies the existence of a unique interior optimum leverage decision for each firm in the market equilibrium after taking all supply side adjustments into account. They exclude bankruptcy, agency and other leverage related costs, admitting that their presence will determine the optimum capital structure. Their model focuses on the relation between the debt level of a firm and available level of non debt tax shields. Bradley et al.(1984) develop a single period model upon this idea. “The model captures the essence of the tax-advantage-and-bankruptcy-costs trade off models, the agency costs of debt arguments, the potential loss of non-debt tax shields in non-default states, the differential personal tax rates between income from stocks and bonds.” The value for the firm that can be created by the use of interest tax shields depends on several factors. Interest tax shields increase the value of a company only if they will be fully used. Higher non debt tax shields, such as depreciation and amortization and tax credits, will increase the probability of wasting interest tax shields. Therefore, De Angelo and Masulis propose a model that takes different possible states of earnings into account, affecting the actual value of debt  and equity: For earnings greater than s2, tax shields can be fully used and increase the value of the enterprise and value of equity. For earnings smaller than s2 but larger than s1 the value of the firm will be the face value of debt plus a fraction of the value of the tax shields, determining the value of equity. This possible outcome shows that an increase in NDTS would decrease the need for debt tax shields, keeping volatility of earnings constant. For earnings smaller than s1, the company will find itself in financial distress, the value of equity will be zero and the value of debt a fraction of the face value of debt. The loss to debt-holders can be described by: . The current market value of the firm is determined by sum of the actual market value of debt and equity:, taking into account the vectors of state contingent. Bradley et al.(1984) introduced to the formula of DeAngelo and Masulis personal income tax considerations to adjust the market value of debt and equity. Bradley differentiates the equation V with respect to B the promised interest payments to bondholders, setting B as a first order condition. The market value of the firm is maximized when equals zero. The first term in this expression represents the marginal net tax benefits from debt.  The second term represents the probability of wasting tax shields. The third term represents expected cost of financial distress. The market value of the firm is maximized when equals zero. The model allows re-differentiating the first order condition in respect to each parameter and shows: The equation shows that trade off theory basically involves three aspects determining leverage decisions: An increase in the cost of financial distress (k) reduces the optimal debt ratio.Higher non debt tax shields (  reduce the optimal debt ratio. Increasing the personal tax rate on income from equity increases the optimal debt level, debt decreases the optimal debt level. The figures depict the results of the simulation of the firms optimal leverage decision. Sigma, on the horizontal axis describes differences in volatility. Each line in the figure depicts the functional relation between the optimal debt ratio and the variability of the firm’s value, for different levels of k and NDTS. The optimal debt ratio is inversely related to the variability of firm value, if costs of financial distress are significant. Asymmetric information describes the state that two contractual parties do not have the same information about the contractual agreement. Information asymmetry is a necessary outcome when information is confidential and needs to be kept
 from competitors, i.e. on one hand. On the other, educating investors takes time and money. The existence of so called information costs is unavoidable for any firm. Furthermore, moral hazard and adverse selection may result from information asymmetry. Akerlof (1970) described adverse selection as a problem of uncertainty. The manager of a firm usually knows more about the real value of its assets and investment opportunities than the investors. As a result some issues will be under or overpriced. The Lemon problem describes that market participants adapt their behavior and would predict a reduction of quality, as a result of information asymmetry. Moral hazard, from an economical point of view arises from information asymmetry, when one contractual party bears less of the downside risk, but has more information about the actual state - a conflict that may arise between bond and stockholders is studied in the context of the principal agent problem. Adverse selection problems will lead to conflicts between old and new or inside and outside shareholders. The introduction of this topic set the framework for new approaches to explaining capital structure. The basic idea is that only inside managers know the true value of a company’s assets and growth opportunities. The manager’s perception of the relative value of its assets to the market value would determine the choice of issuing equity or debt. The outside investor can only interpret this signal and assume that managers’ thinking their company is overvalued issue equity. Managers, acting in the best interest of its shareholders try to mitigate the problem of assets being underpriced by following a pecking order. The underlying idea of the pecking order theory was already observed and clearly expressed by Donaldson (1961): “Management strongly favored internal generation as a source of new funds even to the exclusion of external funds except for unavoidable ´bulges` in the need for funds.”The term of pecking order was established by Myers and Majluf (1984), defining the financing behavior of a firm, following a pecking order: Firms prefer internal finance, such as retained earnings and will adjust their dividend payout policy to their investment opportunities. If external financing is required, firms will choose the safest type of fund first. They prefer debt, than hybrid securities, such as convertibles, and as a last resort issue new stocks. According to the concept of information asymmetry, there might be some cases where managers even pass up valuable investment opportunities by refusing to issue new shares. This is in the state, where the costs to old shareholders of issuing new shares outweigh the NPV of the investment project. The pecking order hypothesis, therefore, sees the interests of the management and current shareholders aligned. Managers are forced to rely on internal cash flow because of information asymmetry between themselves and potential new shareholders. Investors might interpret the decision not to issue shares or to issue debt as a good sign and see it as an indicator for quality of the firm. Baskin (1989) sees in addition to the effect of asymmetric information, tax and transaction costs to be in favor of a pecking order explanation of corporate financing behavior. Direct costs of retained earnings might be smaller than those of issuing debt, banker´s fees, i.e. Second, the personal income tax payments on income from dividends by the investors can be reduced if retained earnings are used to fund new investment projects. In the previous paragraph, capital structure emerged as a result of the problem of asymmetric information. The signaling model focuses on the personal behavior of managers. According to Ross (1977) managers know the true distribution of expected returns. Thy benefit from increasing the market value of the firm´s securities and will suffer in the case of bankruptcy. By issuing debt the risk of bankruptcy increases for the firm. Managers will issue debt, in order to benefit from the increase of the market value of the firm, only until the point where the personal penalty for the managers, related to the increase in the probability of bankruptcy outweighs the benefits. Therefore a higher proportion of debt is regarded by investors as an indicator of quality. Since marginal expected bankruptcy costs are higher for low quality firms, they will not imitate high quality firms by issuing more debt. High quality firms are therefore allowed to take a higher portion of debt. The main empirical result is that debt to equity ratio is positively related to profitability. In Ross model, quality of the firm, debt level and bankruptcy probability are all positively related. A model by Heinkel (1982), similar to the previous mentioned, suggests that high quality firms have a higher value of equity, but lower quality bonds (lower market value for a given face value). Signaling being a high quality firm by issuing debt will increase the market value of equity on one side but decrease the market value of debt on the other.  An additional explanation of the differences in capital structure can be given by the market timing framework. The market to book ratio of equity is used as indicator if a firm is over or undervalued. The hypothesis says that firms tend to issue equity when their market value is high relative to book value and repurchase equity when market value is low. According to this concept, the capital structure of a firm is affected persistently. The empirical study by Marsh (1982) focuses on how companies select between financing instruments at a given point in time. He finds that the decisions of issuing equity or debt by a company are heavily influenced by market conditions and the past history of security prices. This is essentially a behavioral model, implying the preference of the management issuing equity in times of strong performing stock markets and issuing debt when interest rates are low. Analyses of long-run stock returns also give evidence to the market timing theory. Firms tend to issue equity when the cost of equity is relatively low and repurchase when the cost of equity is high. Analyses of earnings forecasts suggest that those firms tend to issue equity when investors are too optimistic about future growth. Surveys of managers are consistent. Baker and Wurgler (2002) ask how market timing affects capital structure. Their results suggest that it has persistent effects on capital structure. In their empirical study leverage is the dependent variable and market to book ratio the independent one. They find that low leverage firms raised funds when their market to book ratio was high while high leverage firms raised funds when their m/b ratio was low. The basic regression result is that leverage is strongly negatively related to this measure of historical market valuations. “But in view of the fact that it is usually argued that co-ordination will be done by the price mechanism, why is such organisation necessary? Outside the firm, price movements direct production, which is co-ordinated through a series of exchange transactions on the market. Within a firm, these market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the entrepreneur-co-ordinator, who directs production.” In 1937, Ronald Coase posed the classic transaction cost problem: When do firms procure in the market and when do they produce to their own needs? He argues that differences of transaction costs are mainly responsible for the decision to use markets or hierarchical forms of organization. The transaction cost approach defines a firm as a governance structure, assuming that the behavior of its participants is only limitedly rational and sees incomplete contracting as a consequence. Contractual hazards are the result of self-interest seeking and opportunistic agents. With reference to the limited rational and opportunistic behavior TCE examines alternative forms of economic organization to reduce transaction costs caused by incomplete contracting and contractual hazards. Williamson (1998) proposes to treat debt and equity not only as alternative financial instruments, but rather as alternative government structures. The proportion of debt to equity should principally depend on the characteristics of the assets of the firm. Transaction cost reasoning supports the usage of debt governance, which establishes strong rules, to finance re-deployable assets and equity governance, allowing much greater discretion, to finance non-re-deployable assets. In this sense, a higher debt to equity ratio limits the decision making authority, concerning the strategy of the firm and further investments i.e., of the equity holders and the managers of the firm. Agency theory considers an organization as a nexus of contracts and refers to moral hazard and agency cost, instead of opportunism. The separation of ownership and control is regarded by the classical agency theory. New institutional economics literature mostly focuses on the normative aspects of the organization. Jensen and Meckling (1976) define an agency relationship as a contract under which the principal engages the agent to perform services on behalf of the principal, by delegating decision making authority to the agent. The Agency problem assumes, if both parties are utility maximizers that the agent will not act in the best interest of the principal. To limit resulting divergences of his interest, the principal will establish appropriate incentives and a monitoring system to reduce the aberrant activities. So called bonding costs are to ensure that the agent will not take actions which would harm the principal. In addition there will be some decisions of the agent, not maximizing the welfare of the principal. This difference is referred as the
 residual loss. The sum of those monitoring and bonding expenditures and the residual loss is defined as agency costs. Agency cost increase with the degree of separation of ownership and control.As mentioned before, agency costs appear because of the separation of ownership and control. If ownership and control are in one hand, there are no agency costs. Jensen and Meckling distinguish between different forms of agency problems. First they analyze the effect of outside equity. If the owner manager of a firm sells some of his equity claims, his proportional claim on the revenues falls, which will encourage him appropriate corporate resources in the form of perquisites, since he will only bear a fraction of the costs. Furthermore, the owner’s incentives to dedicate a significant effort to find new investment opportunities and to maximize the value of the company will also decrease. Since minority shareholders will realize and align incentives, invest in monitoring and expect a residual loss, the agency costs will be reflected in the price they are willing to pay. These agency costs are an unavoidable result of the agency relationship and mainly absorbed by the owner. The owner manager will try to keep the agency costs small and only accept to create this relationship if benefits are high enough to outweigh them. Benefits can arise from the availability of profitable investments. Jensen and Meckling, given the existence of agency costs and the discretionary power of managers of large corporations, find it difficult to understand the historical growth in equity. Limited liability seems to be one additional attractive feature of the corporate form. But if this would be all, why don´t we find most companies individually owned with a tiny fraction of equity and the rest debt? Expanding an enterprise by new investment projects and growth opportunities opens the possibility to design a whole hierarchy of fixed claims on assets and earnings, paying premiums for different levels of risk. Jensen and Meckling see mainly three factors, associated with the existence of debt, influencing the decision how to set up this framework: High leverage engages owner managers to engage in activities with a high pay off, but a low probability of success. If it succeeds he captures most of the gains, and the creditors bear the risk. By promising the bond-buyers a low variance project, with stable cash flows and then taking a high variance project, reduces the market value of debt and increases the market value of equity. With increasing debt to equity ratio, the risk aversion of the (controlling) equity holders decreases, because the present value of returns on equity is higher on risky, volatile projects than the present value of loss. To limit the managerial behavior bondholders include various covenants in the indenture provisions, reducing the value of the bonds. Provisions include constraints on dividends, future debt issues and maintenance of working capital. Practically, it is difficult to protect bondholders and to limit the riskiness of projects in most operating aspects of the enterprise. Monitoring costs include writing and enforcing those provisions. Furthermore, the ability to take optimal actions by the management is sometimes reduced. Bondholders will engage in monitoring costs until the nominal marginal costs are equal to the benefits.Bankruptcy occurs when a current payment on a debt obligation cannot be met by the firm. Equity holders loose all their claims and debt-holders bear the difference between the face value of their claims and the market value of the firm. Liquidation will occur when the market value of future cash flows will be less than the marketable value of the assets. Bankruptcy is not costless and consumes a fraction of the remaining value. The value of debt is related to the bankruptcy costs and to the probability of bankruptcy. Jensen and Meckling believe that bankruptcy costs are relatively small and not a major determinant of capital structure. Mergers might be used to avoid bankruptcy, reorganization costs are much smaller. But revenues and operating costs are not unaffected by the probability and the cost of bankruptcy. Executives might get a higher salary to bear the risk of unemployment. Also business partners have an interest in a low bankruptcy probability to build a sustainable business relation; this type of cost related to the probability of bankruptcy might depend on the industry and the position in the supply chain. Debt will be used as a source of financing if the marginal agency costs of debt are lower than agency cost of equity and because of tax benefits. A high degree of outside financing increases the amount of total agency costs. The agency costs of debt are zero when no debt is used and the agency costs of outside equity, when no outside equity is used. The combination of debt and outside equity can reduce the total agency costs. Jensen and Meckling assume that there is a point where an optimal combination of debt to outside equity minimizes the total agency costs of outside financing. If a higher portion of outside financing decreases or increases the optimal debt level, is speculation. Jensen (1986) points out that control effects of debt are a potential determinant of capital structure. Increasing the debt to equity ratio affects the organizational incentives to motivate managers and reduces the resistance to retrenchment. The obligation to make debt payments increases the organizational efficiency. Debt decreases the discretion of managers to spend free cash flow and thus reduces the agency costs of free cash flow. As discussed before, leverage has also agency costs of debt. Therefore the optimal debt to equity ratio is reached at the point where the marginal costs of debt offset the marginal benefits. The control effects of debt issues will be not as important for high growth companies with low free cash flows. Those companies have to acquire capital from the financial markets, which role is to evaluate the company, its management and projects. The control function of debt is more important for organization with large, stable cash flows, but low growth opportunities and even more important for companies, which must shrink. In this context, it has to be mentioned that growth increases managers’ discretion and power. Therefore managers have incentives to grow beyond the optimal size and increase resources under their control. Their compensation is also positively related to growth in sales. On the contrary, competition in the market requires managers to reduce average costs and increase efficiency to enhance the probability of survival. Harris and Raviv (1991) find that a larger debt level improves the liquidation decision because it makes default more likely. Under all equity financing, managers will try to keep the firm running, even if the assets are more worth than the present value of future cash flows or their liquidation value. Under this assumption, an optimal capital structure trades off higher investigation costs against improved liquidation decisions. Their model predicts, that firms with lower investigation costs and a higher liquidation value, e.g. a higher proportion of tangible assets will have more debt and are likely to have a higher firm value.  Reputation is mentioned to moderating the asset substitution problem, where levered equity holders choose risky investments to benefit from large gains with bearing only part of the risk. Managers of a company with a long history of not defaulting will be more likely to choose safe investment projects rather than maximizing shareholders equity. Young firms with little reputation might be more likely to choose risky projects, and after surviving they might change their behavior. Long established firms, with a long track record, might choose the low risk project in order not to lose valuable reputation and benefit from low interest rates and will have a lower probability of default. Managers might also tend to choose the low risk project not to lose their personal reputation. An explanation is given by Hirshleifer and Thakor (1989), the managerial labor market would more distinguish between success and failure, rather than valuing the maximization of expected return. This managerial behavior reduces the agency costs of debt and allows companies to increase the debt ratio.

 
 Hundreds

STAGE VISUALS, 2014

Concept and design of stage and stage visuals for Hamburg based electronic pop duo Hundreds. Technical concept, pre-production and support on tour as video operator.

Ongoing project with more than 150 shows since 2011 in Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Lithuania, Estonia, Iceland, UK and USA.

We did concept, design and animation. We also developed the projection setup which was meant to be as unique as possible and at the same time flexible enough to fit into venues with very different layouts and sizes.

The challenge was to considerably enrich the concert experience while not outshining the band's performance. Our personal goal was to establish stage visuals as abstract as possible but at the same time always with a strong and clear link to the lyrics and music.

GENERATIVE STAGE VISUAL, 2015

After touring with our friends Hundreds for several years, we finally had the chance to create a real time generated visual for their sold out double show at the HAU theatre in Berlin. Together with Dimitar Ruszev we got to play around with body tracking and audio reaction and faced all the challenges coming with that. As these concerts were a quieter and more broken down version of the usual shows, the slow motion graphics were the only visual part of the whole set.

Words of a Middleman

INSTALLATION, 2012

»Words of a middleman« is a Wireless Router analysing network connections in a local network and displaying them on its integrated display.

APPROACH

Wireless routers are a connection to the internet and thereby a local hub to our digital communication. With their help we send emails, connect to other devices and surf the web. In carefree interaction with our computers, we think the network traffic is handled calm and confidential by the wireless router. In this space of digital intimacy the wireless router is a silent observer. It demonstrates the intangible nature of digital data and we perceive the router as a symbol for our connection to the internet. In this major role as middleman in the digital communication he doesn't get enough credit, in form and content. The project »Words of a middleman« describes a scenario, where the wireless router steps out of its shadow existence and communicates actively his role.
Inspired by the narrative style »stream of consciousness« the router emerges as a narrator, observes the events within the network and journalize them publicly. Devices, servers and their users act as performers equally and are in steady dialog with each other.

I'll be home for Christmas

DATA VISUALIZATION, 2012

The visualization of US flight data evolved during 72 hours of Visualizing Global Marathon 2012 and won in the infographic category.

The main idea was to relate the given data set to worldwide recurring events and customs like holidays and vacation times as well as to exceptional events like 9/11. Looking at the data this way we could find both certain patterns and disturbance of these patterns during the last 20 years.

In the end we generated a set of information visualizations and gathered them into a poster named »I'll be home for Christmas«. The challenge was to find a certain question, that could be answered with the data set of worldwide flight traffic, and to create a proper design of these insights within two days of a very intense weekend.

Metacognizer

RESEARCH, 2011

An experiment to find new perspectives on the so far strongly scientifical analysis of brainwave data in collaboration with the »Cluster Languages of Emotion« of Freie Universität Berlin.

A human's emotional condition is measured through electroencephalography (EEG) as the balance of a human being’s concentration and relaxation. The data streams’ are being audio-visually translated and then output into the test environment as projections and sound. While simultaneously seeing and hearing his visualized brain waves, the participant reflects his own brain activity. He is influencing the reaction of his emotional state’s representation in a resonating feedback loop.
We asked ourselves: What are the consequences of these kinds of reciprocal effects?

Similarly to the generated moiré-like visual structure the sound generator produces overlaying sinus waves, which get placed and rotated within the room. According to the mood of the proband, the system creates different patterns of sound and imagery, merging and rotating at varying speeds.

A highly immersive full dome projection environment can dissolve any reference points which possibly cause severe perception-changing effects. Furthermore its multi-channel audio system allows sound to be placed at any desired point within this space. A strong influence on the emotional state of the participant and a mesmerizing experience can be created, resulting almost in a feeling of virtual weightlessness.

End Pilot

MUSIC FESTIVAL, 2004 – 2009

This is how it started, our first project: idea, concept and realization of a music festival. We were young, naive and strong-minded. A small group of friends who didn't want to accept the fact that we had to travel a couple of hundred kilometres to see our favourite bands in concert. So, in our home town, we started our own festival and concert series disregarding genre boundaries and paying lots of attention to details.
After an exhausting but very rewarding five years it came to an end, with all of us leaving for new places and challenges. More than twenty concert nights took place, including performances by artists like Nils Frahm, Apparat, Slut, Polarkreis 18 and Kangding Ray.

Ethical issues on cyborg technology: Diversity and inclusion

by Enno Park

Progress has reached the point, where cyborg technology is leaving the sphere of mere science fiction. Whereas society as a whole has formed a symbiosis with technology long ago, individuals are now starting to merge with technology as well. The effects can already be studied on the example of smartphones, computers, and the internet. The ideas of „repairing“ humans, of medical implants exceeding natural abilities, and even of upcoming non-medical implants lead to a lot of ethical questions and to re-thinking the concept of inclusion.

More than 300.000 people worldwide have an artificial ear ii NIH Publication No. 11-4798 (2013-11-01). "Cochlear Implants". National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. - they wear a cochlear implant, that provides mostly satisfactory hearing to deaf or nearly deaf poeple as long as they had developed the necessary brain structurs in their early childhood. The success of the adaption of the implant varies from person to person. E.g. in my case, the understanding of spoken language increased from 25% with hearing aids to 100% with cochlea implants measured in a quiet environment without background noise. When observing the development of prosthetics one could state that human beings become more and more „repairable“. Concerning my case, it was simply that: a repair of my defect hearing after 22 years of nearly deafness. Because technology has become part of my body, I identify myself as a cyborg, though I reckon that only a small group of the disabled persons wearing prostheses feels the same way, even though technology has become a part of their body just as well.

The term „cyborg“ was first created to describe a cybernetic organism based on „altering man's bodily functions to meet the requirements of extraterrestrial environments.“i ii"Cyborgs and Space," in Astronautics (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline. The term was extended when Donna Haraway identified the breakdown of three boundaries in the last century: between human and animal, between organic lifeform and machine, and between physical and non-physical.i iiiCf. "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century". Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature. Routledge. ii For the first boundary Sigmund Freud showed that humans not only act rationally but driven by instict and subconsciousness. For the second boundary, modern brain resarch and genetics recognise humans more and more as a kind of biological machine. For the third boundary, we still cannot grasp the phenomenon of spirit and mind, even though the development of artificial intelligence using neuronal networks for pattern recognition has made a big progress. In accordance with this ambivalence society as a whole has formed a symbiosis with technology decades ago and can be seen as a cyborg society, even though the individuals seldom see themselves as cyborgs. In the last years technical devices and computers have not only become smaller and smaller, but also closer and closer to the body. Smartphones and wearables are ubiquious today, and from an engineer's point of view the implantantion of electronics is mostly reduced to the question of how energy can be supplied inside the body.

As a conclusion from this development, I prefer to use the following definition: A cyborg is a human being with an electronical device implanted in or steadily attached to the body with the purpose of increasing individual senses or abilities beyond the occasional use of tools. Cochlea implants are one of the first devices that come near to complying with this defintion of a cyborg and thus mark a milestone in the history of prosthetics. Unlike most prostheses they are not longer worn as a tool or garment, but are implanted in the body and connected to the nervous system. When it comes to prostheses, there is a wide variety from tool-like wearables—such as ancient wooden legs, which are used only when needed, but not necessarily while sleeping or working at a desk—up to devices that keep up vital body functions—such as pacemakers. Normally, these prostheses don't increase senses or abilities beyond a normal extend. Cochlea implants, however, profoundly alter natural hearing; they make it programmable. Whereas for a healthy person the world sounds the same every day, persons with cochlea implants can control their hearing. Via remote control they can raise or lower volume and choose between several presets for different environments such as specifically optimizing for understanding spoken language, filtering environmental noise, amplifying very faint sounds, or disabling any filters for full musical enjoyment. It is standard to change the frequency range of the device or to map certain frequencies into other areas of the range. This way even hearing ultrasound is theoretically possible with a reprogrammed cochlea implant.

This variable hearing conveys an interesting parallel to another aspect in Donna Haraways work: the „situated knowledge.“iiv "Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective". Haraway, Donna. Feminist Studies Vol. 14, No. 3. pp. 575–599. 1988. With this term Haraway describes knowledge that can be true or false on the same object depending on the particular situation, and tries to cope with the limitations of the human perception from a post-structural point of view. This abstract topic in science criticism becomes relevant for cyborgs in a completely non-abstract way: the more cyborgs can control and vary how their senses adapt to nature and environment, the more they will experience how much their concept of the world depends on their senses and point of views. In enhancing and controlling the senses lies a chance to have a broader view on the environment and feel closer to nature as a simple, non-abstract every-day experience. In spite of some losses compared to natural hearing the cochlea implant exceeds normal senses, which makes it a „cyborg device.“

Usually, implants are only used for medical purposes, but the first hacker groups have started to invent small implants such as magnets in order to feel electromagnetic fields, RFID-tags and NFC-chips in order to connect an implant to a mobile device, and small sensor boards in order measure body functions. At the moment, this trend is far from mainstream, but when you keep in mind how many people are willing to modify their body for aesthetical reasons—e.g. tattoos, piercings ans cosmetical surgery—the integrity of the body seems to be dependent on culture. Non-medical implants could become mainstream quickly as soon as they provide useful benefits in comparison to wearables. Currently, it is hard to outline what such a device would look like—comparable to predicting the smartphone one hundred years ago when the classic telephone just started to prevail.

This trend brings up several ethical issues on body integrity, control, security, and above all social inclusion. Discussing these issues is no longer a gedankenexperiment; it has already arrived in our society today. When athletes with prostheses started to outrun their non-disabled competitors, the question of „techno doping“ arose in the field of sports, marking cyborg technologies as creating unfair advantages. vvFelix Gillette (10 November 2004), "Racing tall: A Paralympian stands accused of getting an illegal leg up", Slate When the first Google glass surfaced, an activist group called „Stop The Cyborgs“v vihttp://stopthecyborgs.org/ started to distribute signs for restaurants to prohibit the use of the devices in their establishments in fear of being photographed or filmed without their knowledge. And the fact that the trend is taking place both in the medical and in the non-medical realm shows that these issues concern our society as a whole.

Most peoples' first reaction to the merge of human and technology brings up the fear that their body's integrity could be injured. I, however, don't see that as a serious problem, because, as mentioned above, we already have a culture of  non-medical body modification in significant parts of our society. More important seems to be the question of control and security. Recognising that a person can be a cyborg entails that technical devices are treated like body parts, e.g. confiscating a smartphone could be valued as physical injury in the future.

At the moment, medical implants are restricted medical technology and can only be adjusted by experts. This limitation exists for good reasons. Misusing the tools for fine-tuning and reprogramming devices like cochlea implant can lead to serious damage for the the cyborg. As a result these cyborgs have no opportunity to manipulate their devices and try out new applications, for example to be able to hear ultrasound, as mentioned above. They also have to trust vendors, clinics, health insurance, and even the government that their devices are not misused. For instance, one can imagine health insurance companies using surveillance or collecting data to apply different insurance fees depending on a person's behavior.

The situation is already tenuous when it comes to computers, smartphones, and other devices ranging from quantified-self measurement to home automation. We are surrounded by sensors and leave a broad data track with whatever we do. Black hat hackers and viruses threaten vital infrastructures, vendors control which apps we are allowed to install on our devices or remotely delete data from e-book readers, and several secret services spy on computers and the internet traffic all over the world. With cyborg devices becoming mainstream, all those problems would aggravate severly and could have the potential to comprimise our body and even vital life functions.

Except for the drastic solution of simply stopping the use of digital devices—implanted or not—, open source software and hardware could offer a way out of the dilemma. Publicising the source code and construction plans of the device seem to compromise security, but any security issue can be seen as a bug that can be eliminated in a process of peer review by independent experts. In addition, theoretically everyone who is willing to delve into the workings of their device, is able to find new and surprising applications.

Furthermore, implants exceeding a human's natural senses and abilities bring up the next ethical problem: inclusion and the social question. People argue that gaining extra abilities with cyborg devices could lead to a bigger gap between rich and poor. In my opinion this is a trivial thought and not neccessarily a consequence of technology but a political question of distribution. Unequal access to goods, education, and career opportunities is a problem that existed far before the digital or even the industrial revolution and can only be solved on another level.

An interesting effect of cyborg technologies is that they uncover subtle discrimination and a lack of inclusion in society. While prostheses are meant to offer help, disabled persons sometimes feel them as a kind of performance pressure to fulfill the needs of society and economy. In many discussions  I experienced that a feeling of „not being good enough“ or not being accepted the way they are is common among many handicapped persons. E.g. the deaf culture sees itself threatened by the cochlea implant for several reasons. In the first years, cochlea implants weren't good enough to provide a satisfactory understanding of spoken language. People who are born deaf lack the brain structures to decode sounds and spoken language, and very few of them are able to learn it as adults. All that led to the image of the cochlea implant as a poor solution. This took place in the context of the rich culture deaf people have developed around the sign language.  This culture was suppressed by the doubtful educational practice in European schools for the deaf by forcefully eliminating the usage of sign language.v viiSturley, Nick (2010). "Eight Resolutions". Milan 1880; http://milan1880.com/milan1880congress/eightresolutions.html ii Even though this happened in the well-intentioned approach to make the children fit for a hearing world, the deaf often developed a feeling of being declined by society as what they were. Deaf people fear that their culture could cease to exist when most children grow up with their sense of hearing owing to a cochlea implant. Some more radical spokespersons of the deaf community already call the cochlea implant a „cultural genocide.“ vviii Cf. „Pediatric Cochlear Implants: Medical Miracle or Cultural Genocide?“ by Holly Heffley, University of Kansas School of Nursing, http://archie.kumc.edu/bitstream/handle/2271/848/STT-JUNW_2010_Heffley_Pediatric-Cochlear-Implants.pdf?sequence=1

Also non-disabled people face interferences from outside. Society is thwarting peoples' attempts to modify their bodies for non-medical reasons. One will have difficulties to find a physician who is willing to implant non-medical cyborg devices into the body. Such operations are regulated by ethical commissions and would impinge the hyppocratic oath in most cases. This leads to the side effect that self declared cyborgs have to sidestep to piercing studios, which could increase the surgical risk due to lower standards compared to medical surgery. This is ironic considering that nobody will encounter problems to find a cosmetic surgeon for purely aesthetical reasons.

Inducing disabled persons to undergo surgery for implants while at the same time deterring non-disabled persons from altering their bodies is nothing else but the attempt to normalize individuals. That is the opposite to the thought of inclusion, which is, in a nutshell: providing barrier-free access to social life for any person with any disability as far as possible. This thought had effect on countless laws worldwide and the UN convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, esp. Article 17 „Every person with disabilities has a right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity on an equal basis with others.“ iixCf. „Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities“, Office of the High Commissioner on Humans Rights, United Nations x Cyborg technologies are often associated with Star Trek's „borg collective“ and co-optation. The social trend to normalization leads in the excat direction that critics of cyborg technologies fear.

On the contrary, cyborg technologies offer the chance to understand inclusion as a continuum cointaining individuals with a wide variety of abilities and disabilities without defining a norm. For, any norm excludes people, which then have to be re-included with great effort. In addition, the concept of a normalized human being goes hand in hand with the idea of a human as a repairable machine. Most disabilities are far too complex to be „repaired“ as simply as hearing loss. The idea, that anyone could be repaired leads to less efforts on inclusion and, in the long run, to discrimination when a disabled person is not able nor willing to have technical implants. A cyborg is not an ubermensch, but simply another person with abilities, disabilities, individual experiences, and cultural peculiarities just like humans always have had.

# Nokia to drop Cellular providers

The actual title in the article in Ars Technica is "Cellular providers want Nokia to drop Skype from cell phones". Two cell service providers in the UK are supposedly up in arms over Nokia's inclusion of Skype software on its N97 handset, and are threatening not to carry the device unless the software is ditched. This stance is not only annoying to consumers who are beginning to like VoIP, but it could also even hurt the carriers' business in the long run. I find this pretty upsetting, and makes me want to rewrite the sentence to say the opposite: "Nokia to drop Cellular providers".

My sentence is of course just an exaggeration, but I wish it could happen. I find the prices of cell phone calls and messages very high compared to the price of data transmission over DSL or cable. The thing is, I could have an iPhone touch with WiFi or some other portable device where I can install any software I want. Then I could send and receive any data I choose, including bidirectional audio (Voip, like Skype for example), video calls, or text as long as I want, not just 160 characters. That's pretty much unlimited monthly transfer without paying for each call or message. No abusive charges for roaming either. There are projects like the Fon - Skype WiFi phone that let you talk for free to other skype contacts anywhere where a wireless connection is available.

I recently experienced this. A friend bought an EeePC and flew to a city in the other side of the world. She called me from that city using Skype from different locations. The computer found available wireless networks while walking around. When she called me I could hear and see what was around, thanks to the webcam. It was a surprising experience. No contract, no dialing numbers, not limited to a few characters, better quality than mobile or land line phones. It felt like live tv transmission. Of course I've used webcams before, but when you can see good quality video from the street it's something else. Some would argue that's stealing someone's connection. But they are free to put a password for it. I know people who leave it open on purpose. Sharing connections is the base for projects like Fon or Freifunk.

Of course cellular providers will fight that you are able to send messages and call from out there without paying their fees. But I think that when fat connections are available anywhere, these companies will have to change or disappear. I don't understand why aren't they smarter and see the possibilities and try to innovate offering something new before other's do. Instead, they try to hold strongly on to what they have now. I guess they just try to get the biggest number of clients, and to get the most money out of these clients, without considering so much which product would make the most sense to the customers. I've seen this myself where I've worked before.

In these days you can have a flat data plan on your phone, and push-email. That means that if you receive an email, you are immediately notified. So your friends can send you 'sms' (actually an e-mail, not limited to 160 characters) for free. If both you and your friends have such data plans and cell phones, you wouldn't need to send sms anymore, saving some money. Normally cellular providers forbid using Voip in this situation. But just because they want to charge more for the same service. It would not cost them more to allow it, but people would stop calling using their networks. That's how I think it should be in the future. Flat rate data transfer anywhere.

# At Skizum Studios

The first Sunday of May 2009 I gave a small talk at the Skizum Studios in Berlin. Scott Bolden had the great idea of inviting two creative persons every two Sundays to describe projects or interesting facts.

For me it was quite an improvised happening. I'm not used to talking in public, and that was one of the reasons I wanted to do it. I talked about Finland, Mallorca, nature, waves in the sea, curiosity, science, the "hydrogen bomb" I created when I was a young kid, computers, programming, randomness, measuring power consumption, testing battery charge, harbors, interesting states of mind, happiest moments in life, being lost, paragliding, inspiring events, creativity, math, among others.

I also showed some creations, like my home page, the sound gun, a concert I did, photography and more. You can find links to some of those creations at my home page. There was no time to explain many other things I had written down, like this sound game I did in my job at Panfu last year, which was inspired by Toshio Iwai's work. I like thinking about interfaces.

I also didn't have time to mention that I've been helping with the programming of the website www.ae911truth.org It's a website where many architects and engineers ask for a new investigation of what happened 8 years ago in New York, and has a 2 hour video presentation of many interesting facts. Or that soon I will visit Uganda and develop phone applications to help doctors in developing countries. I plan to describe this journey in this blog, alternating English and Spanish.

Here are links to some inspiring events you may have a look:

Online conferences at TED (see "Rated jaw-dropping" on the left).

Transmediale. Event in Berlin, in January/February each year. There I saw lots of interesting things, like Syscapes #interlude, and Recipes for Disaster.

Recordings of the Chaos Computer Club conferences in Berlin, each year in December: (some very geek, others not so much, like 2916 Wikileaks)

OFFF: another inspiring event I attended in 2006. Tickets are always sold out very quick. There were so many amazing things shown there. This one from Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman is one of them (see the whole playlist in YouTube!).

I hope that in the future I take some time to write posts about all the subjects I mention above, and upload some other creations I did not present at the Skizum Studios.

Thank you everybody for attending!
I hope you enjoyed it :)

# Pick Up Spore - Live 2007

Taas tuli tyhjäks - earth  by  hamoid

This is the recording of my performance in Mallorca. This was meant to be played in the Pitch Festival, but it was cancelled last minute, so I played in an open air bar next to the cathedral (Ses Voltes). I find this piece as a movie without images. It includes different types of sounds: field recording I did using SoundMan binaural microphones outdoors, sometimes I mounted the recorder in my SoundGun:

Those microphones are normally mounted in your ears, and they record the true 3D sound as we humans hear it. The 3D effect is so real that, when using headphones, I kept turning around when I heard my cellphone beep to realize again that it was coming out of my headphones and not from my phone.

The piece also includes synthesized sounds, classical instruments, and non conventional instruments too. To me the track represents life on this planet, including beauty, rain, destruction, money...

# Back to 52ºN

Friday we spent the day packing our luggage and our data. We shared photos, transfered video tapes and copied the files we've been working on. The way to the airport was quite interesting. We left the house at sunset time, when a big traffic jam takes place every day. Even there are no traffic lights and cars move slowly, I think drivers don't get stressed. Edward always seemed very calm. I haven't seen people screaming or honking. Actually I haven't seen anyone agressive at all.

Right now I hear people honking all the time here in my street in Berlin because they have to drive slower than usually. Today Fete de la musique takes place and some streets are for pedestrians only, so cars have to drive other routes. Sometimes someone even screams. Why are they so stressed?

While driving to the airport I found it sad to see a woman sitting on a dusty sidewalk grilling corn to sell. She was there with her small son that tried to climb on her. The kid smiled and laughed, and she played with him. Around her there was some trash. The corn was quite black after a long time in the small grill. I wonder if someone was buying any of it. It's strange that it felt sad for me while they seemed happy.

Edward took a different route to avoid the traffic jam. We drove on some dirt streets with huge holes and bumps. The car's bottom often hit those bumps. I saw the night life in Kampala. There were some pickup trucks with loud speakers, pool tables, bars and lots of people hanging out there. It was a busy and very interesting area. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabalagala

In the photos, a mobile card shop. Then Sarah, Miquel with Conejo, Solomon, Hakim and I, and finally someone being driven around in a bicycle on the way to the airport.

It was amazing how bright the stars were on the road to Entebbe. You could see some even near the horizon.

Tuesday 60ºN :)

# Big heavy bird

This afternoon, in the trees in front of our house, two big birds were sitting in the trees. Because of their weight, the branches where they sat were bending down. They were quite slow, not like small birds which normally jump and look around nervously all the time. These birds turned their heads slowly. Sometimes they began looking slowly down, to then jump to a lower branch. Other times they jumped sideways repeatedly on one branch, until the weight was too much for the tip of the branch. They ate (or at least scratched) part of the outside of this eucalyptus tree. They seemed to be a couple, probably an old one. It didn't look like they just met, but anyways when one flew to another tree, the other followed.

# Conference recording hardware

This post is for geeks :)

Today we tested a device that will be used to record lectures at the university. The device is a computer with a built in touch screen. This computer has two video inputs, one for a video camera that records the person giving the speech, and another video input for the laptop of the presenter. The device records sound, the presenter, and his slides. The system automatically does OCR in the slides, and it indexes the text, so it can be searched afterwards. Then it sends the presentation to the Internet, either in real time or later when a connection is available. The conference is then available for students to be seen online, including an automatically generated time line that includes texts and slides. If the presentation is real time, people watching the conference can interact with the presenter, for example sending questions. It's also possible to upload a presentation to the server from the presenters laptop, using it's own microphone and webcam. The streaming then happens using a RED5 Flash server (open source).

Yesterday by accident the power supply blew up (don't ask), but an indian technician had it back working today in just an hour. Miquel was very happy about the fast reparation. So for the test we connected everything up, showing Miquel's two Ugandan helpers how it all works. I spoke a few words to the camera while clicking through a power point presentation, and then it was all  uploaded to the server almost automatically, where it could be seen in a web catalogue of presentations.

The system will offer a lot of educational content online to students and professionals in the continent. Soon a fat optic fiber will give Africa fast access from one university to another, and to the rest of the online world ( see http://www.seacom.mu/intro.html ) making online education a reality.

Going back to my cube :)

By the way: I haven't seen a single mosquito here... and maybe... a total of one fly? (I guess in the country side it's something different)

# First application demonstration

Today we showed the telephone application to other people for the first time.

In the morning we discussed all the video shooting locations and ideas for the coming days.

The morning was quite a stress, because we only had a few hours to do some changes and fixes to the application and server side, but the Internet was at its worse moment since I'm here. I tried to log in into our server for hours without any luck. We were running late for our appointment, so Bob, Michael and Sal left with one of the drivers. Meanwhile Hakim ran to a shop and got an UMTS stick. He arrived home and in seconds, I plugged the thing, logged into the server, edited some files typing at super speed, closed the laptop and left.

Sal and Michael came from the Bay area to create a video presentation of the project to raise funds. Bob is the director of our project. I heard he was a doctor in India for a very long time. The first video shooting was at Doctor Stella's office. She's the director of the Reach Out project near our place, and she's so nice and friendly! I was touched by her words. She explained the history of her project that takes care of people affected by HIV and TB, their difficulties, how it has evolved over time. Bob and Miquel presented her the phone application and web site to find out what she thinks about it. Her reaction was very positive.

The second video shooting was with two health workers, while some chicken ran under our feet. You can see some photos taken while the phone was presented. Their reaction was also very good. I expected they might be much more skeptic, but they said it could save lives! After filming kids were amazed with the camera, laughing with joy and making silly faces in front of it.

Until yesterday I thought this phone application is a good idea, but it was just software in my test phone and the server. That changed today. Hearing the comments from Doctor Stella and the two health workers made it obvious that what I've been programming can have a real impact in people's life's. I don't know how to describe it, but I'm surprised.

Amazing how many interesting people I meet here :)

# First day

Today I could actually see what's around us (yesterday at night I could not see much). Everything is very green. There are some interesting colorful plants, and very big birds and some eagles flying around. In the morning we walked for half hour to a shopping center where we had breakfast. The cars here drive on the left side, so one must be careful when crossing the street. While walking I passed a children school called "The hungry carterpillar". I also saw a sign saying "beware of the falling mangos" stuck on a tree. After breakfast we checked out the supermarket. Quite big, and with a great variety. Then we both rode a Boda-Boda with a young driver to another shopping center (after discussing the price). There we bought some food, activated the satellite tv contract, exchanged some Euros and had a great mango juice. I noticed some people from India and I asked Miquel about it. He said that many used to live here, but they were kicked out by a past government. In recent years some have returned to the country. A taxi driven by a friendly woman took us back home in a few minutes. She gave us her phone number so we can call her if we need a taxi. Miquel stored it in his personal collection of taxi driver's numbers.

Today is the mothers day in Uganda, so the school in front of our house was closed, and I was told everything was more quiet than usually. Congratulations to all mothers :)

Then we started working in the project. My part is to program cell phones that run Google's Android operating system. I was doing some tests during the last weeks in Berlin using a phone emulator, but today it was the first time I run a program in a real G1 phone :) The internet was going really slow, but it looks like maybe we solved it (deactivating QoS).

During the day I took some photos from the roof-balcony, I recorded the noise from the fan in my bathroom, I ate a great tasty mango, had dinner in an Indian restaurant (our driver took us there, 5 minutes away from the house) and had many long interesting conversations with Miquel about our lives, being true to oneself, technology, people, the time he worked at MSF in north Uganda...

Time now to enter my cube and rest until tomorrow morning. Good night all!

Un abrazo para Ricardo!

# From the equator to the Nokia country

I noticed a extreme change in what surrounds me during the last days. The streets, the people, the air, the sound, the temperature... it's another universe.

I've seen people with red (almost fluorescent) hair, a Gothic couple with huge platform shoes, black leather clothes with metal pieces attached, black paint in their faces, I've seen punks and large stylish sun glasses... I tried to imagine a Goth in Kampala... would the kids run towards them screaming "muzungu"? or would they run away screaming something different?

I imagined explaining someone that you can buy broken jeans that look old in Europe that cost as much as one months salary in Uganda, and that extra effort is taken to break them and wear them out. I'm pretty sure they try to take much care of their few clothes down there.

I also imagined showing these different groups of people to one of the persons I met last weeks in Uganda and then asking "in which of these styles would you like to dress?". The idea of a custom party (or mask party) comes to my head.

Funny how I can feel at home in such radically different places after such a short period of time.

# In Kampala

Finally here :) it's 22:30. My trip started at 04:30, when a taxi picked me up in Berlin. The way to the airport was quite weird: the taxi was shaking laterally quite strongly while in the highway. The driver said it was the road, but I don't believe it. I've driven there before and my car did not shake like that. I thought the wheels were going to come out. This was Berlin, not Kampala :)

Later I met Miquel in the Sbarro cafe, in Schipol airport (Amsterdam). Huge airport, with expensive magazines (I had to ask someone if that "15" written in the in the magazines were Euros or not). The flight to Kampala went fine. Nothing to see through the window, since it was cloudy all the time. But I could choose between lots of movies, music, games, etc on my own display. I watched The International, which I found quite good. Then Ironman. Finally, a documentary about sustainable and ecologic architecture. I was surprised with how many drinks and food we got. I lost the count, and everything was quite good. Last years I always flew in those low cost companies, and I realised the difference today. In the KLM magazine I saw a great variety of products, some digital cameras, and a ring for 500 Eur.

At the Kampala airport we got some forms from people with masks in their faces. We filled those forms saying that we have no fever, throat pain or cough. Then we got the visa. Edward, our driver, took us to the house. It took about 45 minutes on an asfalt road, with some red dust in it. It was already night, and there is almost no street lighting, so it was quite dark. The whole way smelled like burned plants. Miquel said that's very common. Some trucks driving up the hill in front of us release very black smoke, which I could smell. During the whole travel in the road we passed lots of people just walking in the road, or hanging out there. Scooters with one, two, three or even four passengers. There were many small places selling stuff. The light was almost always fluorescent tubes or energy saving lamps. Some areas had lots of scooters parked and people around them. Others crossed the smoky road running or with bicycles. In other places people would be sleeping at night, but here the whole way you would see people. I saw some playing volleyball inside a court. Somehow the drive reminded me of some road in Malaga, in a summer night.

When we arrived Robert (the guard) opened the door. The house is big, with grass around it, electric fence, very clean and new looking, and frogs and other night animals are singing out there. Time to sleep now :)

# Last video shooting day

Today was our last day out there filming. We drove back to Rakai (across the equator), to the same place where we did the circumcision filming last week. From there we drove to the country side to visit some community health workers in a AIDS help center. I showed the phone application to a doctor and two other workers while Michael controlled the camera and Sal made the questions. We received positive comments and some good ideas for new features. On the way back I could not stop taking pictures from the car. I filled my card with 150 images. I enjoyed shooting at high speed (1/500s) while I turned my body quickly to follow objects and people at the side of the road. It was very hard to aim with the car moving at 80 km/h... a fun game :)

At the equator I checked using the phones GPS feature if the line was at latitude 0º, but there was a 12 meter difference, whatever that means :)

Today we said goodbye to Bob and his son Daniel. Tomorrow early Michael and Sal (filming crew) will leave very early in the morning, and Miquel and I will fly back to Amsterdam in the afternoon. This will be the end of my first visit to this continent. Hopefully more follow :)

During the last week every evening when I get back home I'm extremely tired after so much travelling and exciting events. I only have energy now to write these lines and upload some new photos to Flickr.

# MU-JHU

Today I spent many hours with Sal and Michael Jackson doing video shootings at the MU-JHU (Makarere University - Johns Hopkins University Research Collaboration, http://www.mujhu.org/). I heard very interesting stories of how they investigate and got successful results for avoiding mother to child HIV transmission. I feel lucky to meet so many smart people in charge of projects that try to improve other people's lives.

# Muzungu

Today we visited Gaba. Edward drove us there. During the ride, as usually, we saw smoke and dust, and motorbikes carrying all kinds of stuff, in this case a large piece of glass, maybe 120cm x 120cm. A women fell from the boda-boda right in front of us when the motorbike started to move. She looked like very drunk. It took her a few seconds before she could stand up, then she walked away looking for another boda-boda, since the first boda-boda left without bothering to see if she was fine or not. It was quite shocking to see. The area where this happened is know for night life and vice.

Gaba is next to the Victoria lake. It has a market, fishermen, and people doing smoked fish. The fish are placed in large grids (like 2 meters wide), and many grids are placed on top of each other, and all grids placed inside a large container with fire and smoke. The fish come out quite black. I think then the fish (or some of it) was peeled, and the eatable parts placed in a large platform, probably to dry under the sun. On top of this platform full of fish there were two women walking bare foot. They moved the fish around, removing bad parts. Dust from the road flew over them. Some flies walked in the fish. And some huge birds sometimes got lucky and stole a piece. The women threw something at the birds to scare them, but they just jumped back, not going too far away.

I took some photos and Miquel recorded video, which he will post after editing. But I haven't taken many photos here. I don't feel so comfortable taking photos of poverty and the way people live. I don't like the fact that I can take interesting photos because of the bad luck of other people. On the other hand, it can help people in developed countries see how unequally wealth is distributed in the planet...

Suddenly, a strong rain started and everybody run quickly to find a protected place. Miquel and I knew it was coming, so we were already under a roof. A young boda-boda driver came next to me and made many questions, about the tribes in Spain and about soccer. He asked about Barça and Chelsea.

Next we drove to visit the Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi. A guy gave us a great tour. He spoke very well, with an amazing voice that could have fit in a movie. Inside the old king's house he showed me how to play a game which he said was kind of old chess in Africa. It was easy to learn, but I guess hard to master. I hope I can play it again in the future. It's played on carved wood with 32 positions, and 32 seeds for each opponent. He told us about the history of Uganda, the four kings buried inside the house, and traditions.

We went to have lunch, and then we walked home crossing again the slums near our house. Immediately after entering the area, many kids started screaming "Muzungu! Muzungu!" which is the word used to refer to white foreigners. Small kids came running from every direction to see us and reapeated "hello! how are you?". They smiled and laughed. Miquel was walking behind and lots of kids started holding his hands. Later they were holding mine too. If you haven't tried dragging 7 small kids up the hill, I tell you it's quite heavy :) Maybe 20 kids walked with us all the way through the slums. I don't remember seeing such happy children ever before.

# Picking up the trash

When I was a kid, here in Finland they already separated the paper trash, and later the organic garbabe. This was maybe 15 or 20 years before it was done in Mallorca, where I grew up. Many people still don't want to "waste their time" with such things in Spain. This is very different in northern countries.

Recently I was surprised to see a sticker in one of our garbage cans in Berlin, saying that "someone threw something wrong in this container. we will not take the trash away until you fix this". If this happened in Spain the container would probably sit there full until the sun melted the container and the content away :)

Here in Soukka, until one year ago, there was a small wooden house with several trash containers inside. A different truck would come to pick up each type of garbage (paper, white glass, colored glass, organic, carton, plastic, or others). This wooden house has now been replaced by several containers that are mostly buried in the ground, probably about 5 or 6 meters deep. You use your house key to open each container and throw away your garbage. The garbage falls into a gigantic and very strong bag. Once a week, a truck with just one person comes, lifts the huge bag with an hydraulic arm, pulls from a rope in the lower end of the bag, and the content drops inside the truck. In the photo you can see half of the bag. I'm not yet sure of what benefits this system has, but I will find out.

One other interesting thing that came to my mind, is that the 10 floor building where I stay does not have any kind of communicator to let a visitor ring a neighbor, or to let someone open the building door from upstairs. During the day you can just enter the building and ring directly someone's door. But after 8pm or during weekends, the building door is locked automatically, and you can only enter if you have the key. Do people never receive visits from friends after 8pm or during weekends? If they do, they have to go down and unlock the door. Now that people have cellphones you can just ring your friend upstairs, but this system has been there for 20 or 30 years. I think people don't have so many visitors around here :)

Today I ordered a tiny video camera, so hopefully next week I can show you how beautiful Soukka is.

# Post operation

After 17 hours, finally back home (in Kampala). It was a very long day. I spent 4 or 5 hours on the road.

Today was the first time I could see a live operation. I took almost 400 photos from the whole procedure
and the tools used. Here you can see two. I guess the others you don't want to see :) I didn't faint! :)
Tomorrow I will describe what interesting things I saw today.

# Pre operation

Lately I've been programming a lot, so no much time to explore. A demo of the application must be ready next Monday. Today I updated the firmware of the phone to the latest version (1.5) and it went fine. I needed to have the latest version. Updating firmwares is always a bit scary, but if you have a presentation 5 days later and have no chance of getting a new phone in case of problems, then it's even more exciting :) After this update I can record video with the phone.

A woman from Google foundation came to visit us today, and Miquel was explaining her our projects.

Now I will go to sleep because tomorrow we wake up at 5:00 to go take photos of an operation while Miquel records it on video. We will drive across the equator to the hospital that did the study that proved that circumcised men are much less likely to get HIV / AIDS. The material will be used to create a course for other doctors to watch.

Tomorrow first car trip outside Kampala, first live operation too.

Fresh mango juice in the photo.

# School children singing II

The morning I took this photo I had not slept much. But as I heard the music I jumped out of bed and run out to the balcony with my recorder and the camera. There I found Michael, who was filming it. It looks like there are at least two fans of these kids :) The songs still play in my head sometimes. I love the English accent of the teacher :)

I noticed some of my posts were read almost 200 times. Funny, because I have no idea of who is reading these words :)

# School children singing

Two days ago I woke up with these beautiful sounds.

# School of public health

Today the video shootings continued. First with the Dean of the School of Public Health. Bob and Miquel presented him the phone and the application, which he found very interesting. After this Bob and Miquel explained to the camera the project and the technology used. It was a bit tricky because it was outdoors and the wind forced them to repeat the takes a few times. After eating a pizza we attended (and filmed) a very interesting event (the Grant Rounds) in the same campus, at the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI). In this event, they connect the local auditorium with another one in the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore using a satellite link. Cameras and microphones in each side transmitted live feed to the other side. 3 uncommon medical cases from Uganda were presented, the participating doctors in Baltimore tried to diagnose and give their opinions on those cases using the given data, and finally the local doctors presented what was the actual diagnosis, and interesting discoveries. So basically it was a videoconference between doctors in Kampala and Baltimore that brings new knowledge to both sides.


How did Polyphylla originate? What was
your goal in creating the instrument?
There were two elements I wanted to achieve with
Polyphylla. First, in terms of sound, I simply wanted
to create an instrument to produce the kinds of
sounds I enjoy most: complex and evolving textures.
Natural sounds are full of subtleties that change over
time, which make the sounds alive and interesting,
but unfortunately they are really hard to simulate with
digital synthesizers.
The second aspect was related to the usability of the
interface. Many of the synthesizers I have tried
included way too many parameters for my taste. This
gave them flexibility, but made them hard to work
with. Therefore I wanted to design a synthesizer that
was simpler to use without compromising its depth.
Sound visualization is an important element that is
often missing in synthesizers. I believe this can really
enhance the device’s usability by keeping the
interface engaging, easy to understand, and can
even serve as a medium to imagine new sonic
possibilities. Therefore, in the early stage of
Polyphylla’s development, I sought inspiration from
the visual world, hoping to design an approach to
audio generation with a strong visual component.
During the initial research phase, I came across
spectrograms of organic sounds and noticed
patterns that kept repeating. Fractals, together with
additive synthesis, appeared to be the logical choice
to emulate those patterns. And as it turns out,
combining them I was able to achieve my goals for
crafting complex and evolving sounds combined
with simple usability.
Can you tell me a bit about additive
synthesis?
The best analogy to additive synthesis I can think of
is a color palette - you mix a few colors together to
get a di fferent color. A similar thing happens in the
audio world as well. By mixing a few di fferent sounds
together you produce a new sound. With additive
synthesis, the sounds that get added together are
sine waves of di fferent frequencies. It’s based on the
theory of the influential mathematician Fourier, who
showed that any sound can be reproduced with a
set of sine waves of di fferent frequencies and
amplitudes. Speaking the language of additive
synthesis: when you hear a piano note of 440 Hz,
what you are hearing is only its F undamental
Frequency, but on top of the fundamental there are
h armonics which are integer multiples of the
fundamental frequency, and the noise components
which are non-integer multiples of the fundamental
frequency. These frequencies are called O vertones,
as they are tones “above” the fundamental
frequency.
As you might have noticed already, additive
synthesis provides an interesting way to think of
sound numerically. The harmony and inharmony
components in sounds are directly associated with
integer and non-integer overtones, respectively.
Pitched instruments, like piano and guitar have more
harmonic components (integer overtones), while
percussions are mainly composed of inharmonic
components (non-integer overtones).
To make it even more interesting, some instruments
tend to have more odd overtones - like the clarinet,
while the trumpet has more flat amplitude
distributions over all integer overtones. So simply by
changing the proportion of odd and even overtones
you can morph the tone between a trumpet and a
clarinet.
Furthermore, since you can control the amplitude of
each frequency individually with additive synthesis,
you can emulate how a natural sound evolves over
time. For example, when you strike a guitar chord,
the high frequency elements disappear faster than
the lower ones. Also when you strike the strings
harder, the tone appears brighter. The nature of
additive synth makes it straightforward to emulate
these behaviors.
However, to create a harmonically interesting sound
with additive synthesis, you normally need at least
100 overtones and the ability to change the
amplitude and frequency of each overtone
individually over time. This is why sound
manipulation with additive synth is notoriously
clumsy and laborious – you often need to tweak all
parameters of hundreds of partials individually.
Polyphylla preserves the power of additive synthesis
but simplifies the manipulation process with its
fractal-inspired Motion E ffects.
There’s some unique morphing e ffects in
Polyphylla - what are those doing?
The motion e ffects allow the user to draw a simple
shape, a “Motion Motif”, whose structure controls a
huge set of parameters simultaneously and
individually. The Motion Motif can be thought of as a
volume envelope, which specifies volume change
over time. For each frequency, the Motion Motif is
shifted in the time domain or deformed using
algorithms that produce apparently natural behavior.
With one free-drawing envelope and 1-4 knobs, you
can easily bring sounds to life and create many
unique subtleties that change organically over time.
T he outcome could be subtle and organic, or
dramatically abstract and wild.
With your background in programming,
how did you design Polyphylla? Was it all
Max from the start?
Initially I tested various ideas using simple paper
prototypes to avoid getting distracted by technical
details and to focus on the concepts themselves.
Once the idea of Polyphylla emerged, I started
quick-and-dirty prototyping with Max/MSP,
JavaScript, and Processing. The sound engine was
quickly assembled with a bunch of cycle~ and
envelope objects. I used Open Sound Control to
send the envelope data to Processing in which I
prototyped the visualization. Processing made it
easy to experiment with di fferent looks and
behaviors.
How did you bring it all back into Max for
Live?
Once I was certain about the direction I wanted to
build the device in, I started porting the JavaScript
and Processing prototypes to Max. Initially I tried
doing everything with Max/MSP objects, but soon I
reached a performance bottleneck due to the huge
amount of real-time data used for visualization and
harmony modulation. In order to lower the CPU
usage I rewrote the visualization and audio engine as
C/C++ externals.
Are there any particular languages/
methodologies that you used that you’d
like to bring more attention to/which
aren’t too well known?
At some point I realized I needed to build a custom
signal processing component. Instead of directly
coding a C external, I prototyped the component
using the Julia programming language. It is open
source, designed for scientific computing and has a
few handy packages for DSP and data visualization.
It allowed me to test new algorithms and
immediately view the resulting signal, down to the
sample level.
Polyphylla utilizes a unique approach to sound generation which is normally
hard to achieve with digital synthesizers. By employing mathematical models
which are based on shapes and phenomena in nature, it is easy to bring
sounds to life and create many unique subtleties that change organically over
time.
The interface is engaging and uncomplicated, thanks to its visual approach to
sound manipulation. It allows users to draw a simple shape which then
controls a huge set of parameters simultaneously. This innovative approach
has multiple benefits: it makes additive synthesis no longer clumsy and
laborious, it excels as an educational tool and it stimulates the imagination.
Polyphylla excels at evocative ambiences, moving pads, rich textures and
experimental noises - although it’s also perfectly capable of generating rich
basses and punchy leads. Please let me know if you’d like an NFR copy of
the full release for review.
Harmony Effect
Unison - fatten up the sound by adding two slightly detuned partials for each
existing one.
Detune - Adjust the detune amount to the partials colored red in the
Spectrum View.
Wet - The balance between the original partials and the detuned partials.
In the Spectrum View, the original and detuned partials are colored in white and red
respectively.
Interval - detune harmonics matching the specified interval.
Detune - Adjust the detune amount to the partials color red in the
Spectrum View.
Target - Detune All/Odd/Even/Octave/Fifth partials.
All - detune all partials
Odd/Even detunes the odd or even partials. When “Odd” is selected,
for example, the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc. partials will be detuned.
Octave/Fifth detunes partials that match certain tuning. For example,
Octave detunes all partials that are the octaves of the fundamental frequency.
Volume - Adjust the volume of the detuned partials.
Mask - detune partials covered by the mask
Detune - Adjust the detune amount to the partials color red in the
Spectrum View.
Size - Specifies the width of the mask. With higher value to detune more
partials.
Offset - Shift the starting position of the mask.
Random - randomly detune partials.
Detune - Adjust the detune amount to the partials color red in the
Spectrum View.
Smoothness - How smooth the partials are detuned over time.
Threshold - detunes any partials with volume greater than the minimum value
Detune - Adjust the detune amount to the partials color red in the
Spectrum View.
Minimum Volume - Detune only partials with volume higher than the
specified amount
Miscellaneous Effects
Ring Modulator - Adding extra frequencies to the original signal. good for
adding extra high frequencies for percussive sounds.
Dry/Wet Mix - The balance between the dry signal and the signal
processed by Ring Modulator.
Frequency - The frequency that will be added to and subtracted from the
input signal.
Chorus - thicken the signal with the approach how a group of people
singing in choir - blend the original signal and the same signal with constantly
changing delay time
Dry/Wet Mix - The balance between the dry signal and the signal
processed by Chorus.
Feedback - The amount of processed signal feeds back into the input of
Chorus.
Thickness - Increase the value to create a thicker tone. It removes the
high frequency in the processed signal
Delay - Set the delay time of the signal. The delayed signal will interfere
with the original signal to create slight pitch variation.
Delay Time Modulation Mode - This sets how the delay time is
modulated over time. Regular Mode scales the delay time
Delay Time Modulation Amount - This sets the modulation amount
applied to delay time. Higher amount makes delay time vary in a wider range, hence
more dramatic changes of the pitch
Delay Time Modulation Rate - This sets how quickly the delay time is
modulated. Higher rate generates more rapidly varying pitch.
Reverb - enhance the original sound with/by adding natural room
acoustics.
Dry/Wet Mix - The balance between the dry signal and the signal
processed by Reverb
Size - The size of the virtual room. Larger sizes produces longer reverb
times. Smaller room size produces a more metallic tone.
Decay - The time it takes for the reflection to die off.
Damping - Makes the overall tone brighter or warmer.
Diffuse - Increase diffuse amount to put early reflections closer together.
Reduce Diffuse to create more discrete echoes.
Modulation
Modulation makes it possible to change the timbre rhythmically/randomly or to react
to the way you play your midi controller. For example, change the Brightness by how
hard you hit a key.
1. Modulation Scalar - Scale the amount of modulation applied to the associated
parameter. At the center the modulation is scaled to zero. On the right side, it scales
the original value from 0 to 1. On the left side it scales the value from 0 to -1.
2. Modulation Ring - When a Modulation Source is in use, it shows the actual value
the parameter is currently using.
3. Modulation Sources
3.1 Modulation using envelopes & LFO
The following modulation sources can be found on the lower part of the interface:
3.1.1 LFO-1 & LFO-2
3.1.2 Amp ADSR - the volume envelope for the overall sound contour. It can be used
as modulation source as well.
3.1.3 Auxiliary ADSR - an additional envelope for modulating parameters
3.2 Modulation Parameters through MIDI Controller
These modulation sources can’t be found on the interface of Polyphylla, but are MIDI
information sent from your MIDI controller.
3.2.1 Key-Tracking
3.2.2 Velocity
3.2.3 Mod-Wheel
3.2.4 Pitch-Bend
3.2.5 Aftertouch
Visualizer
The Polyphylla Motion Visualizer enables the user to work visually in designing
sounds. There are two different view options.
Graph 1
Spectrum View
Spectrum Tab shows the default energy level of all frequencies used in the current
sound. The height shows the magnitude of each frequency. Red lines indicate
detuned partials, when the Harmony Effect is enabled in the Effects tab.
Graph 2
Motion View
When a motion effect is enabled, the Motion Visualizer displays a visualization of the
magnitudes of partials evolving over time. Each curve represents one partial, with
the low frequency partials at the front and the high frequency partials to the rear.
Time progresses from left to right.
1. Sweep - offsets the start time of the Motion Motif for each partial
Amount - global dial for all Sweep Modes. It scales the amount of offset time
applied to all partials. Higher value results in more dramatic offset times
Sweep Modes
1 Down - linearly increase the offset time as the partial frequency (ie. the
Harmony Ratio) increases
2 Up - linearly decrease the offset time as the partial frequency (ie. the
Harmony Ratio) increases
3 Curve - non-linearly offset partials. The offset amount changes as a curve.
The shape of the curve can be modified by Phase and Density
Phase - shift the phase of the curve, which changes the offset amount
applied to partials
Density - set the density (also called period or wavelength) of the sweep
curve. Lower values result in more dramatic changes across the partial spectrum,
while higher values result in smoother changes.
4 Random - randomly offset partials.
Seeds - Each variety is a different set of random values to offset partials
Offset - Change the mapping between the offset amounts and the partials
2. Attractor - stretches and bends the Motion Motif with an attractor.
1. Attractor Location X-Y Control - click and drag along to change the location
of the attractor. The horizontal/vertical axis represent playback time/magnitude
respectively.
2. Offset - this changes the location of the attractor among partials
3. Deform - semi-randomly deform the Motion Motif for for each partial.
1. Deform - The amount of deform applied to all partials
2. Randomize - How random the original Motion Motif is deformed. High value
results in more dramatic timbre movement, while use low value to create more
subtle, organic timbral changes.
4. Drift - smoothly change the magnitude of each individual partial over time
1. Speed - How quickly the magnitude of individual partials changes over time
Motion Motif Editor
Click and drag to draw a curve as a Motion Motif. Depending on the Motion
Effect in use, it will be applied differently to each partial.
Presets
Factory presets for the Motion Motif
Loop Mode
This sets whether to loop the Motion Envelope for the duration of note, and if so,
how.
Speed
How many cycles per second to play back the Motion Effect.
Harmony Ratio
The Harmony Ratio of a partial is calculated in proportion to the fundamental
frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 440 Hz, and the partial
frequency is 880 Hz, the partial’s Harmony Ratio is 2.
There are harmonic and inharmonic partials. Harmonic partials are partials with a
whole-numbered (1, 2, 3.. etc) Harmony Ratio. While inharmonic partials are with
non whole-numbered Harmony ratio (ex. 1.23, 1.33, etc). If the fundamental
frequency is 220 Hz, then a partial of 440 Hz is a harmonic partial, while 550 Hz is
an inharmonic partial.
With pitched music instruments like piano, guitar, or clarinet, they are composed of
mainly harmonic partials. And bell or percussions are made of inharmonic partials.


When I am reading I will forget details straight after passing the sentence. If you ask me what I've been reading about I'll have a hard time giving you any details at all. The maximum I could give is a rough summary what it is about, in my point of view. I am using my subconscious memory.

Nobody is going to take you by your hand and spread your art for you. Nobody is going to choke and do it for you. At least for now.
I don't even know what I am doing, what my mission is. What my statement it. I figure it's still to be a mirror to society. My work should reflect what important things are going on.
Don't say I do images and videos. I am interested in how technology influences art practice. About autonomy of the artist, about fundamentals. About how to reveal secrets.


am trying to figure out what an artist is and what being an artist involves and what this title actually means. it is the state of a person which tries to have an overview over the world and the things happening. absorbing it and trying to live outside of usual patterns and tries to develop its self by increasing its consciousness. an artist is free from activities which don't have the purpose of training the mind and feelings. he tries to live outside of all boxes that exists and tries to show its flaws and general abouts. being an artist is not about what you produce its how you live and what you are. its about details and the overview. it's about extracting the extremes of life. being directly about one direction but appreciating and knowing about the infinite amount of ways possible. its about uniting contrary extremes. doing the impossible. it's about developing thoughts by yourself, about being independent. it's about being serious and playful. its about changing oneself, not being steady but still hold on to ones principles. it's about making choices. it's about consciousness and wakefulness. its about verzicht. its about pure life. it's about ideas and meaning instead of names and titles. its about not caring about the word artist.
Ask people what leading an artists life for them is about.

t simplifies the view. people kind of drift into seeing the world only in 2d. pictures of events and scenes are the only reason to visit the place or make the event happen in the first place. this takes it one step further. reduction to a simpler being. though there is some information loss involved in the process. we lose something. it takes the element out of context and it only makes sense to someone if he/she knows its origin. like when trying to rebuild the original from one of the 1d-ified images is not possible. we need to guess parts of it. expect parts of it. information is lost but rebuilt through memory and experience. and this is the key, its something extremely human and a unique capability of human brains. trying to rebuild the original is displaying the difference between brain and CPU.
when people take pictures they unconsciously perform a transformation: turning 3d into 2d. this project takes this concept a little further. it turns 2d images into 1d images. the original image is impossible to reconstruct, like the 3d world is impossible to reconstruct from a 2d image. this means during the transformation of taking a picture information is lost, the world is not recognizable from an image, like the image is not recognizable from the 1d representation. why would you want a representation like an image of a scene if you can perceive the reality.
technical background: the images are based on photographs of different scenes. the representation of an image in the computer is through pixels. an image consists of rows and columns of pixels and each pixels consists of three components, red, green and blue. for each row the average color of all pixels contained by that row is calculated and is set as the color for every individual pixel in that row.

a highly conceptual piece which encounters a development in the art scene in the way to totally engage with it and exaggerates it. nowadays art can be perceived on line, it is convenient in the way that everybody can look at art from wherever they are.may it be videos, documentations or stils or shots which capture the work in total- they all are basically the same to the viewer. an image on a screen in the viewers usual environment, a different configuration of pixels. not only art, this development can be adopted to a lot of other

When you've received a digital version you'll be getting two files, one of the actual work and one file which contains the digital signature proving that this is an original and that it originated from the artist. You can find this out by verifying the file via keybase.io with the command

i want to find some life or something real and non artificial with what i do. I'm looking for the human in machine, tech and the way the digital world is built.
i want to create different realities. with mist of my recent work I've been unconsciously researching this. figuring out the line between things which are commonly recognized as real and those things which are thought of as fake, artificial or digital.   with my work I am pointing this shift out. I'm engineering context around things/entities in order to make them real. my work heavily focused on individual perception of the world and its borders.   what do I want to find out? I want to find out what I want to find out without being pushed and interfered from institutions and entities which have no eye ear and mind for culture and the struggle I'm going through in order to develop something of value for people. even art institutions are poisoned by press publicity and need to impress people with money.
I want to leave the single medium field and identify a new natural mix. creating an interface to a medium constellation that can be created/triggered simpler than the sum of the individual media. I want to develop an emergent approach to general creation of digital art output. the approach to creation in the course of the emergence of digital art has been copied from ancient times. the approach to use the computer for those tasks did indeed enable a new level of creation and is unique to all other methods. though the possibilities are not yet exploited to the maximum. one may argue if that is necessary: it is. the outcome may not be satisfying but the approach needs to be explored in order to find character in media.
i want to bring people emotionally and sensationally together by facilitating utilities which split us apart. the tools are at hand they just need to be munched together.
my work has always been heavily influenced by the characteristics of its creation. one of my goals in life is to always live in the moment and in the big picture at the same time. I only want to do things that I enjoy doing every moment of it. for example: a job that creates great things but consists of writing emails for 8h a day, is not my choice. maybe I'm so selfish.
a new single access approach to enabling somebody to output multiple media forms via one direct output. like click a button and generate sound and video at the same time.

So Intimate is generative and the result of the mixup of interrelated images. Combining images various ways of expression from photography, illustration, painting, visual design and funny animal pictures. The combination of those still images by overlapping results into an abstract form of a visual style that is initially set by the first image. This constructs a summary of a certain visual style that is governed by the decisions every single creator of the original images made while creating those images.
Thus, each individual image is sacrificed for the 'big image'. The need to compress data even when consuming them is rising and we can't protect ourselves from this evolutionary trend.
In a time where our consumption of images and videos raised to a new record level, the only logical step is to sum up multiple images into one, rather see the synopsis of individual processes and results instead of doing the work of finding your own interpretation of the individual processes and results. Losing control and the ability to judge with valid reason is the consequence.

in 30 years from now, we're going to injest information. we're going to eat a pill and know english, we're going to eat a pill and know shakespeare. this can be applied to any other information. so far, we've been using our eyes to get information a lot, which might be a slow channel compared to what's possible. Through the bloodstream, microbiological information is going to reach the brain and leave information at specific parts of the brain.
by collecting our data, we're basically parsing the information of the 'world' into a format, what we believe would be a way we might know how to injest sooner or later. though, we've never been before good at predicting our future. maybe we're starting to timetravel, when we're smart enough to exactly predict the future. then we're timeless and can predict further with a certain percentage of asurance that this will happen.

During this process, many images are sacrificed for the ‘big picture’ and by observing one image, you’re seeing the essence of a collective thought and idea. It maybe compared to compressing the data stream that goes from our eyes to our brain. The need to compress and summarize data before we’re consuming them with our senses seems to be rising. In a time where consumption of media, say data, raised to a record level, the only logical step is to sum up multiple images into one, in order to quicker grasp the synopsis of what you’re looking at. The downside of this development is loosing control over ones ability to find an own interpretation of the matter, because ones decisions and thoughts are based upon the, possibly lossy, compression of the information one perceives.

flip through books. flip through life, flip through any information. flip through is meta. meta is what changes us, meta information seems to substitute for the actual information.  

the brain is a computer made out of meat.(founder of AI) And this is the point, its made out of living cells and sub-organisms which operate in a network. any one of these cells in our brain is more intelligent than any mechanical, dead, computer. This statement might have been wrong 20 years ago, and might be bring in 20 years again. And that is because the definition of intelligence is changing. Computers make us humans more intelligent by raising the bar of intelligence and humanness. They are a tool to further develop the human self and consciousness of all people towards ??? I dont know.  

pessimism results out of the fact that people think they KNOW what things are like and they KNOW what will happen. this is arrogant bullshit and a pessimistic depression is the only thing those people verdienen. 
things never become what they seem to be becoming, things are always changing. by looking in the future ur creating it to a degree, but please be open and try to show empathy to future selves and stay human. keep the abilitY to adopt to strange changes


would it be possible to train a cnn with line strokes to draw more lines inspired by those? how many lines would it take? what other information would need to be necessary? not justpixels?!
is it possable to output something with a neural network? except from classifications? i dont think so. the generation itself needs to be a different system that can be validated with a neural network that can tell if something is similar to a desired output. whenever something is over a certain threahold of similarity, the goal is reached.


The piece Abstracted Intentions puts concentrated consciousness on display. It is a generative computer performance that is fueled by humanness that has been injected into the program. Usually generative computer programs use mathematical formulas in order to simulate motion. In order to overcome this, in my perspective, cold touch that digital art has a tendency towards, all movements of the piece are guided by recorded data of my own motion. The motion is this case is something very elementary, the movements I produce with the mouse when I'm operating a computer. I am fascinated by the characteristics of these movements, they are extremely simple, as they are essentially paths with a startpoint, an endpoint and the way inbetween. At the same time these movements are infinitely complex and impossible to generatively create and artificially simulate. 
This piece is the result of a long research and experimentation phase. I experimented with various media to approach this concept and finalized on a    generative projection on top of a painting. The projection will be fast and abstract, please see the video attached. The projected lines are the same ones that are painted with thick high quality acrylic paint. It creates the sensation of augmentation of the painting, stressing it's characteristics.


Choose a street in a neighbourhood of your choice. Bring your camera and photograph every piece of text and word you come across. Construct a poem out of the pictures you took- choose inbetween using either images or words.

Take a screenshot of your browser tabs once every hour you are using your computer. Collect two hundred screenshots and create a collage with these snippets. Only the tabs can be screenahotted, no content of websites allowed.

go around in a neighbourhood, take random photos of things. label them with one word. write the label on the thing and take another photo of it.

take random pictures you took with your phone- at least 500. construct a 4k image by looping through the pixels and storing the color of a random picture into the current position of the output image.

draw 20 squares on the screen. half of them are constructed with 4 mouse paths. the other half are mathematically correct squares. pick colors from a mondrain painting.

in a clean room, place >4 screens where as each screen has a computer attached. on each screen there is a person on skype in real time, being open for discussion. each of the person needs to be from a different continent and in general representing all of society.

Use the MousePath libary and connect lines very closely together, so they form a big line. Keep the drawing in realtime and create a sketch that animates the sides of squares and rectangles in that way. Place 28 (invisible) rectangles on the canvas and re-draw their side-lines with the mouse paths that are close to each other. Use approximately 100 individual lines for each cube side. Randomly jump to other rectangles from the side of one.

For this work, hand movements were extracted, reduced to their core characteristics and fed into an unrelated choreography. What is left is the feeling of pure conscious intention.
Let me give you some context, as this project is an ongoing development of finding and utilizing pure character, intention, consciousness, choice. I have been recording my own mouse movements while I am working on the computer for a couple of months now. So eventually I have collected multiple tens of thousands of movements. One movement is the path inbetween two clicks I do. 
I was led to this project by the fascination for the unconscious but yet so intended lines one draws when somebody operates the computer. The lines are all unique and each of them has some kind of concentrated characteristics containing the soul of the creator. The amount of unintendedness, that what happens when you take the lines out of their context and re-purpose them for drawing other shapes, is so strong and puts minimalistic human decision making and choice onto display.
With this endeavor I am extending myself by recording my movements in order to apply them in massive amounts, which would be impossible without this detour of recording. 
Moreover, interestingly, the characteristics of the paths you are drawing when using your computer are heavily different depending on what you are doing. The lines of working in Photoshop for an hour have essential differences to the lines of an hour of erratic Facebook research.
And by combining these concentrated 'self' into various compositions and choreographies, it is almost like i am using myself as a puppet, from a different point in time. Using 'myself' with a bigger sense of quality for the quantity. As Mohr already said in the 60s, you can not overcome a lack in quality by using more quantity. When adding an generic quantity to a system, you are adding nothing. With this work I am researching the possibillities to align the easy-to-create quantity, that enables computer generated graphics, with the quality that can not be achieved by dead, pre-determined, mathematical functions, that I see all over recent artworks, that have been created using digital tools.
Mohr already stated that for a qualitative long term work, the expressiveness of mathematical functions are limited because they are a closed system, disconnecred from human thought and feeling. The use of human intended action in a generative way, eises the quality of the quantity to a new maximum.
I have been creating a repertoire of lines i can utilize; I am directing my own movements from a distance, in a fashion of a puppet cabinet. The distance is in time and purpose. 
This video is a result of accumulated self, it is literally loaded with my intention. The medium is something non-material, my own self. 
A mousepath is concentrated information. Its human measured entropy is very high.
Static and minimalistic forms are being traced by complex line combinations, which are chosen randomly from a set of thousands of lines. 


The work "Composition #9" consists of many choreographies, which are all implementations of the umbrella composition #9. The composition is an abstract representation of the essence of my unconscious mind, putting my past movements onto display. I have been taking very detailed records of the movements I make with my mouse while using the computer, what gained me a repertoire of multi-functional lines, which represent concentrated information, traces of my past. Though, through the extreme abstraction of these movements, the underlying intentions and actions are blurred and the only thing that is left is the feeling that every line used to have an individual intention and has been created unconsciously, without any doubt or aesthetic aspirations.
What drove me to this are the fascinating characteristics of the traces of minimalistic human decision making in contrast to the deterministic qualities of mathematical functions. On the search for possibilities to combine the advantages of generative software approaches with the uniqueness of an individual hand-drawn line, I came to the point where I found out that it is impossible to synthesize these human qualities with existing geometrical algorithms or mathematical functions. Due to the predetermined qualities of mathematical functions, one function becomes a closed system and thus naturally disconnects from human thought and feeling. At the same time I was not satisfied with the thought of actually drawing myself, as this active act of intended expression blurs the overwhelming power of unconscious decision making and action.
Eventually I became aware of the fact that I need to use human generated data as the source and I started recording very detailed information about the movements of my computer cursor, while operating the machine for every day tasks, in order to re-purpose those traces for future experimentation.  With these lines I, in a way, quantified my personal motoric finger print and had the blueprint of universal human 'touch' that can possible be injected into generative systems in order to balance the weight of influence in between computer and human. Wit that I can conduct compositions and choreographies of 'myself' from a third person perspective and observe 'myself' drawing.
What you are reading and seeing is the report of a point in time of that research.


we are developing towards a state where we only want to perceive things that we agree with. anything that we dont like, we go away from very quickly in order to see/hear/read something else that is more aligned with our already existing opinion/worldview. 
it would be good to be totally open to perceiving anything that we then can analyze and work with even though it is heavily against our deepest believs. like this we would be critical and independent.


take everything you ever wrote, feed it into a character learning machine and generate some fake output of yourself. the machine learns from the input text how and about what you write and continues for you.

use mouse paths and concatenate them. always check weather one would leave the screen and only add it when the end is inside the screen. loop this and see what it looks like

I need to create a community that concentrates on conceptual/visual pictures and videos. about visual compositions that are contemporary, inspired by pioneers but not flat.

One should always be able to perform ones compositions. The same as one should always be able to implement ones algorithms.

what is the essential difference between an algorithm and a composition. 
algorithm: list of instructions to perform a task
composition: list of instructions to perform a 

learn how to live code and play super collider. at the same time play visuals according to the characters pressed with the mouse recorder.

a dialogue with myself
The mouse lines are a translation, a morse code of an intention. Where as e.g. Vector Pi (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/416797613/vector-pi-a-geometric-language-encoding) is a classical translation, which acts on the same level of information as morse, braile and, well, characters. I can not transport any more intentions of the author as a sub-tone or their characteristics as a person. It's encoding possibilities are limited and I am applying a more general and abstract translation of something yet un-measurable into that.
computer is not a tool, its an instrument
an idea is not an algorithm, its a composition


e-stream all what happend. pop of the typed characters where the mouse currently is. for this the order the paths needs to be stored and may not be messed up. highlight the movements of the mouse. maybe include the body movement during that time via the camera of the notebook- some kind of 'body-language'- factor, which is just a number indicating the current movemenent. maybe even more than one value.

in the future kids are going to be schooled by algorithms, because this trivial knowledge needs to be simplified/automated. this is insane.

Use Mouse paths to fill geometric shapes with colored lines. You need to be able to properly 'fill' arbitrary shapes will lines, so they seem filled and do not overlap outside of the shape.

Dear Lacunians,
bear with me, this first email will probably contain a lot of bullshit, maybe there grows some interesting things out of it. This will be a lengthy mail, so only read on if you're interested in the collective exhibition next year:
I've been thinking a bit about the upcoming Lacuna Lab Exposition 2016 at Spektrum. My thoughts were mixed, when trying to come up with a way to curate or organize the thing. I don't think there can be something like that for our show, though I will try to be the one pushing it slightly forward for now and taking some responsability. 
I was wondering what we could do, do we do intentional for this occasion created work? Do we make plans to develop some things collectively? Do we just throw all of our pieces in a bowl and try to connect it? I don't know- but since there's plenty of time and Spektrum is small, there's no need to 'produce' something for that occasion. 
I'm pro taking it easy and simply be aware in the upcoming weeks/months of what you and others are doing. I kind of like the idea of having the exhibition as a snapshot of our spot, simply putting the winter onto display. Or what we've been working on in the winter. Whatever it is. A photograph of the dirty seat everybody (or is it only me?) is using to climb out of the window. Your keyboard, which is totally worn out because you've been coding like a champ. Or the lacuna logo made out of the dirt we're sweeping away from the floor. Or a piece that's been intentionally planned and created to be a work of art. The book you wrote about quantum media theory which proves the higgs-boson to be a lie.
I'll stop here (for now). I'm not sure this is the right approach for our show, but I kind of would like to stick out of this blurry pile of sometimes seemingly random stuff which is being promoted by Spektrum. Sorry, this sounds awfully ignorant, but I would like to make a point about that it would be interesting to move some things upside-down, or do something unexpected, just to keep this whole new-media arts thing a little spicy.
Another thing, in case we need funding for anything we would like to do there (finally print a pile of dog shit in gold) there are probably some ways to get some funding from somewhere. It would probably be good to have that e.V. shit sorted by then, but I'm in general positive regarding our ability to figure out the ordinary problem of having too little cash for something supercool. Of course, if anybody ever hears about any opportunities like that- holler.


the government is responsible for providung a secure channel to the internet. if its mail, cloud storage or social media- doesnt matter. though the government is a business, thus is an helpless option.  

Draw random mouse path lines on the screen. Depending on their average position, color them like the rainbow, from left to right.

Take all pixels of an image and put them in one line. Do that for 2000 images, which then represent the rows of the image. Try to stay a close to the original resolution of the images you're using, though it might be good to down scale the images that are used slightly.
Because for a full hd image you have 1920*1080 pixels in width, what's fuck too much.


The painting gets this extraordinary computational touch. It's entirely human and fluid, has no mathematical foundation at all. At least no very obvious one, so it's obfuscated. But the arrangement of the lines creates a gradient that is mathematically perfect. Impossible to find that in nature. And I was not able to create this kind of perfection with my hands either. I could reach it with a machine though.

Paint a painting with a gradient from left to right. The gradient is calculated by the average color of all pixels in y direction. A gradient that goes from left to right, white to black. Still randomly chosen paths, but alternately painted black and white, still woven highlights.

Write program to take screenshots every 5 minutes   of your google chrome browser bar. Dont take a screenshot when Google Chrome isn't open. This can be easily checked by analyzing the screenshot before saving it. If it has the typical browser icons in it, take the picture. Should be doable by just checking for a couple of pixel color values against hardcoded colors that the browser top bar has.  

take a neural network thats trained on text. only show camera recording where the text likeliness in the frame is above some threshold.

I'm writing you because I would like to take part in the geek market you're planning to have on the 20-22nd of december.
I am planning to cut & engrave little images. They will be processed using the laser cutter i modified, that lets me draw in realtime on material.
Moreover I want to sell small acrylic glass tiles with motives like in the images attached. They are based on compositions of lines which I have recorded from my own bodies movement.
Moreover I'm planning to self-illuminate these by putting an less and a tiny battery into them, what makes the engravings shine from the inside. 


Why do I need to learn the technique of machine learning?
I need to transfer myself to a machine in order to learn what I am. This enables me to look at myself from the outside and reflect on my thoughts, actions characteristics.

The painting is a dialogue with myself on a low level. While recording my own bodies movements, I extract some alternative DNA of myself into data. This information about lines and movements can be used to inject a character into any kind of algorithmic composition to transcend it. These lines are a translation of abstract intentions, having had a former purpose but at the same time stand for themselves, expressing the the core of ones personality. 
This painting is heavily influenced by computational and digital means. The computer is not a tool, it's an instrument. An idea is not an algorithm, it's a composition.


Dear Draw a Line team,
I like your service and would, myself, be interested in a collaboration with you. Before I go to deep into what I do, I would like to express how great it is that your initiative exists. I hope your idea is running great.
I actually am based in Berlin for a long time and have just come across your site and would like to know more about your process of including new artists in your program. When you are interested, I would be happy to invite you to my studio to get a glimpse of what I (and the people who I am sharing it with) do. We have founded ourselves about half a year ago and our website is in the process:  http://lacunalab.github.io/
You can see some of my personal work here:  http://mrzl.net/
A little interview here:  http://creative.arte.tv/de/episode/mit-code-zum-gott-werden-marcel-schwittlick-erschafft-generative-kunst
Please contact me here or give me a ring +49 172 7262729


draw a very light paper structure below your graphics. just plain black is too neutral and artificial. and don't forget about creating something beautiful- don't hide your lazyness with strictness/straightness.

Nothing differenciates my work from anybody else. I have the feeling that I do not exist. And I like it. I don't actually want to exist. I am not. Let others be- how terrible. Ich habe das gefühl, dass ich gern das leerste sein möchte, ich möchte bei komplett null sein, um anzufangen. Warum kann ich nicht diskutieren? Warum habe ich einfach keinerlei Interesse für Gedankenspiele.
Aber was sollte man denn damit machen, wenn es denn so ist? Werde ich alleingelassen zu grunde gehen?

I want to extend my research regarding the combination of paintings and digital, visual art. The just recently, by Justin Johnson (https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style), started technique of extracting a style from one image and being able to apply this to another image is groundbreaking and might have a heavy impact on my own many many other people's work.
The technique of applying deep neural nets for in-depth analysis of imagery opens up new horizons in art. Neural network machine learning has already found it's way into most of the big successful businesses and I am sure that there is massive potential in other fields, too. 
I would be willing and very happy to present results and progress of my research to students and staff. I am sure that what I will be able to find out, will be of big interest for many people in fields like the computational arts likewise as in traditional arts. In many digital, creative fields as well as in computer science. 
Some of my progress that I was able to achieve in one week of having access to a good graphics hardware can be seen here:  http://mrzl.net/123/  It's lacking theoretical explainations so far, that's why I am seeking for an opportunity to extend this research.

Dear everybody,
I've already been speaking to a few of you, this idea creating some anonymous-collaborative project, that we could use for our exhibition. It's an idea where it is really important that _everybody_ gets involved.
What it essentially boils down to is the need for 10 pages of text from everybody. This text will then be fed into a recurrent neural network layed out for text. After this is done it'll be possible to extract text/poems from this that reflects all of our output. This already exciting enough to do it, isn't it? What follows after that will be up to us.
Important is that this text comes from YOU. It doesn't matter weather it's outgoing emails, diary entries, notebook notes about projects etc- all these should be sufficient to get some (semi/abstract) meaningfull output. 
As it might be slightly sensitive text, I came up with a way we can organize this. Say everbody who wants to join in on this, has their text ready, not everybody might be comfortable with sending this text via email to anybody (especially not to me most probably). Regarding this, I suggest to use this encryption technique: 
1. Encrypt your text via  https://encipher.it/
2. Save the password(!)
3. Send me the encrypted text via mail. It's going to look something like this:
EnCt268ef7fe91b58d5200ecc99c07cea8d3db73b0c2868ef7fe91b58d5200ecc99c0V6vPsNmxOQD UFCWxYVbo6m48IwEmS
Decrypt it at https://encipher.it
4. Once I have all encypted texts, we'll have to all meet in person in order for everybody to decrypt their text, so the network can be trained on the real text. The plain texts will then directly, after the network has been trained, be deleted. So nobody will ever be able to read your text.
5. Done. The network contains the texts, which can not be re-extracted. What will be possible is to sample the network for text that is deeply influenced by all of our input. Wicked!
There's a talk here by Andrej Karpathy, who's doing lots of scientific research with deep neural networks, in case you're interested in some very techy explaination:  https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6611-visualizing-and-understanding-recurrent-networks

After visiting you speak about the vision off the biennale in Berlin, I came to the conclusion to write again, reminding you of the relevance my approach towards your outline of the festival.
After being able to ask questions and haven gotten a tad more side information of the format, I want to extend my proposal from a month ago. Deep inside stands for me for the place where truth lies. In contrast to the pre-determined impression this idea might have, I wasn't too outline the some questions this is opening, on the other hand.
I am hereby proposing another time, a different approach with a similar essence, maybe you get my drift now:
I am combining digital works of friends and myself lately, on a genetic level, by training a deep neural network on the style of our images. Here you can see some starting points:  http://mrzl.net/123/
For the Biennale, I am thinking of a series of fine art prints. Maybe around 5 of them. Each of them will be an automated collaboration between a friends painting and graphics of myself.
As I found out in the yesterday's meeting, there is some potential for funding, which is great to hear, as my plan is indeed depending on some financial help, even though it is not actually shooting at the starts, yet. In order to compute the images, I need to rent compute slots on an online virtual server hosting platform, as the computer hardware one needs for this not average consumer level anymore. I don't want, intentionally, to drive too deep into the technical aspects at this point, yet, but this spricey part makes it possible to render high resolution images. The images you can see on the link above are at the maximum quality you can achieve with the resources I have available and they can, in this state, be printed no bigger than A4 size, though it's necessary for more image detail to be revealed to be able to look deeper at a slightly bigger physical scale.
I would be very happy to be included into this Biennale, trying to find an audience for my work in more remote places outside of Europe. I would like to see this as an invitation to a dialogue, possibly adjusting aspects of my work in relation to the space in Moscow.

Write a book that is nonsense on page one and gradually makes more sense until the end. A fine gradient from totally pseudo profound bullshit to actually profound content. Hum.

What do I expect from the conference?
I want to gain some starting thoughts for what is currently going on in the world. This is really inspirational research. I want some starting points for new work of myself. Learn about new technologies and secret things.
Though I don't know yet what kind of format my new work is going to have. I'm not even sure if I should even start new work. But this is a method of taking input from the world and let it soak through myself.

It should be possible to have OF inside 7th sense host application by compiling the app as a dynamic library. (adjust in VS the output from .exe to .dll)
Then, there may not be a main() function in the dll of the application, though another entry point. There needs to happen initialization via ofInit() and gluInit(), though not sure about the glu init. Apparently the opengl context will automatically be used by openframeworks, when there is one context active from the host application.
In order to do that, one needs to extend from ofBaseApp, implement some functions and not create an actual window, but start a renderer, or a programmable renderer.
  

  Hey all!

Starting a new thread, since that last one was about 100 messages thick and had the wrong subject line anyway. :P

Good news!  I've just gotten off the phone with our new contact at Tækker, Herr Marcel Magdeburg, and learned that Tækker himself has looked through our application and given the OK!  So, the next step is for aBe and I to meet with Marcel in person to discuss the contract next Wednesday.  At that time we hope to negotiate for the renovations period that we discussed a couple meetings ago.

We're nearly there!

The next steps for all of you lovely people will be to fill out a membership form to join Lacuna Lab (if you were not at the founding meeting), and a letter of intent to pay rent for space at PLU44a.  We're working on those forms now, so keep an eye out for them in the next email from us.

Thanks for helping make our co-creation space a reality!  Hope to see you all in person soon to celebrate over sekt (or other appropriate fizzy drink).

Woohooo!

yippiiieeeee !!! :D

Nice! Jemma (some of you might know her through code jam, or stammtisch) is interested in the place as well, now added to the discussion :)

That’s such great news!  Thanks for the update, and thanks so much for everyone's work on making this happen!!! Let me know if there’s anything you need help with! 

Super great news! 

awwwyeah

Yes!!! 
Added Kyla to the list, she's also interested in joining in

sweeeet
we should have a party :)- also for getting to know each other- so many new peepz

thumbs up for party!

First party in the space is gonna be awesome!

Hi peeps, just lettin ya'll know that i cant come tonight. im still stuck in wannsee finishing up some work.. enjoy everybody, ill try to stop by a little later.. :)

Did I miss something?

its not an official PLU meeting, but just a meetup where many of us often go to . ya know

Hey all!

So aBe and I met with Herr Magdeburg at Tækker this morning to go over the contract.

Unfortunately there remain a couple paperwork hurdles for us to jump before we can actually sign the contract and get the keys, namely around getting the e.V. officially notarized.  And we may, in turn, need confirmation from the Finanzamt about our e.V. application in order to get notarized, so we might be stuck in a holding pattern until we hear from them.  We'll definitely keep you updated on that as it develops.

The contract itself looks good: it's in the name of Lacuna Lab e.V., with a move-in date of 1. May 2015. Also, as soon as we have our e.V. notarization (and another from Tækker's notary), we can take the keys and start working in the space.  That is to say, our first few weeks there would be rent-free, depending on how quickly we can get the notarization done.

For the money matters: The Kaution is a bit more than we anticipated, as Tine told us it would be 3x monthly rent, but the contract calls for 5x.  We are probably able to get it down to 4x instead, but we shall see.

Also, aBe and I have been doing some market research about what sorts of plans and prices co-working spaces around Berlin offer, so we should have some set prices and plans soon.  Keep an eye out for that "intent to pay" form that I promised in the last email.  :)

That's all the news for now--sorry that we can't bust out the confetti just yet!  But that just makes it all the more exciting when we finally can!

Yo,

Thanks for the update on today.

Just to confirm, what are the order of the steps for gaining officialness of the e.V.?

Also was the 3-month Kaution originally promised or just given as a guideline?

We are waiting for a response from the Finanzamt, where we sent the eV
documents. That's one step.

What the immobilien wants is a document from the notary. One notary said
we first need the Finanzamt document. But we will call two other ones
tomorrow to make sure.

When we have the notary document, we can sign and get the keys.

Soma here, with an update on the status of the Lacuna Lab co-creation space.

The Paperwork

So over the past two days, Thomas, aBe, and I have met with a notary to officially petition for entry into the Vereinsregister, a necessary step to giving our e.V. legal standing.  As previously mentioned, this was a prerequisite for our signing the property contract with Tækker.

We now have the paperwork that Tækker was looking for, and could in theory go forward with signing the contract next week, but, with the help of our translator (thanks again Thomas!), we discovered that there a few issues we need to address in the contract before signing it.  Namely, one line could be interpreted to mean that we could not use the space as an atelier or event space, another may give Tækker the right to evict us for no reason, and another may imply that going forward in our current state could be financially unwise, particularly for aBe and I, who are held personally responsible for everything until the e.V. is officially founded.

All that said, we would like a little more time to go over the contract and amend what we can.  (We're looking out for you!)  As always, we'll keep you updated as new information develops.

I know it's been slow going (trust me, I know), but it's worth being punctilious now, to avoid unhappiness in the future. :)

Next Meeting

We also think it would be good to have another gathering sometime soon, not just because I miss you guys, and we have some new faces to introduce (:D), but also so we can officially nail down some questions, including:

    Who is officially committed to joining the space, and for how long?
    What pricing tiers will we offer?
    How should we divide the space, usage-wise, and which activities/abilities are most important to everyone?

We'd like to get a more concrete financial plan together, so having input from everyone about what level of commitment they can make will be very useful.  I plan to put together a few options for pricing plans and space usage that can get the conversation started when we meet.

And now, the most fun part: finding a time that works for everyone!

Please fill out this Doodle to let us know when you're available.  Since it can be quite hard to get a big group like this together, please try to be as available as possible, so we can maximize attendance. :)

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Looking forward to seeing you all in one place!  And I'm really hoping the *next* time we're all in one place, it's in the studio. :)

hi all, I haven't introduced myself as of yet, but I have been getting these emails via Steffan and am very interested in this project, looking forward to meet all of you and hear more in person!
(I am an artist working in the fields of performance/dance and mask making, recently graduated from an MA and have been searching for just such a collective space/innitiative to be part of :) 

I am very happy things are walking!

Im going to Australia tomorrow. I will be back in June 9th. 

Please, let me know the procedures and the discussions of the meetings..
Also, keep me informed about the news. Sorry i will not be able to be in the next meetings...

don't forget that I am IN!

Have a nice spring start!

Thank  you peepz for your effort. I would say even tho it seems so close we shouldn't  hesitate with the plu space. But reading somas mail you don't seem so. As you know I found them a little  fishy all the time.  at least a month in advance to make the space allright is still a must I would say.
There should be still other options we should be able to find, especially now more eyes are looking and we have an e.V. Now. 
Wow so many new people! Hi Kyla!  

Do we have a location yet for the meeting on Wednesday? We could go to Cafe Katulki like for the previous e.V. meeting.  :)   

So excited to meet the new people, and getting Lacuna Lab closer to being a reality!! 

So the masses have spoken, and the next Lacuna Lab meeting will be held...

on 22. April 2015, at 1700.

at Prachtwerk ( Ganghoferstr. 2, 12043 Berlin )

It's a sizable cafe/bar with a good atmosphere that shouldn't have any trouble fitting us all.

We will discuss options for membership tiers/fees, running costs for the space, and membership contracts.  It won't be all business though: we also have some new faces to introduce in the group--let's all have a drink (alcoholic or otherwise) and get to know each other better!

Let us know if you have any questions beforehand.

Looking forward to seeing you all on Wednesday!

As some of you already know, I’ve been in contact with the BioTinkering e.V. about them possibly joining us in the PLU space to build a Bio-Hack lab.  A member of their group, Rüdiger Trojok, will be joining us tomorrow for the meeting, although unfortunately he can’t make it until 6:30pm.  So if any of you would like to meet him and learn more about their group, you might want to stay around for that.  :)

Just wanted to drop you a line to let you know that aBe, Alex, and I just left the meeting with Tækker, and the contract has been signed! ((cue applause))

We negotiated a renovation period of three weeks, so rent isn't actually due until 16 May. ((cue more applause))

But don't pop the champagne and sekt just yet--we still have a paperwork hurdle or two more to do before they hand us the keys.  We hope to get these done ASAP and receive the keys sometime next week.

As always, I'll pass along the information as soon as we have it.

Thanks to everyone that came out last night and signed contracts!  It really helped to pull me out of the paperwork dumps and remind me that we're doing this to get awesome people together to do awesome things.

The next meeting should definitely be in The Space.  :D

superswag! feel kissed :~)

got a callback from the notary.

We can have an appointment on monday at 14:00. They have a state approved (vereidigt) translator inhouse.
The fee will be around 200 plus half an hour Dolmetscher, she said.

The notary will exchange with Magdeburg to receive the documents. We can decide to bring in our own translator as we like or still cancel the meeting. Taking the inhouse Dolmetscher would safe us travelling costs.

Cool, thanks Alex. Are you arranging the payment? Do you need us to give our share of the cash beforehand?

Applause, applause! Second the motion to extend many thanks to all those involved for all of your hard work:) So very excited to have met you all and to meet the space.

I wonder how much half hour costs.

BTW, they don't normally take cash. They send invoices.

It's a good amount of money, but I doubt many other notaries have
in-house interpreters AND could give us an appointment in two days.

I called recently notaries and they were giving appointments in one or
two months. Then coordinate an official translator that must go there...

I suggest we take this one. What do you think?

Then we have the keys next Tuesday (in theory).

It's a bit of a hit but we're dividing it among us and it's just this once. I would also go for it.

I don't think there's a meeting decided yet.

But we did go to the Notar on Friday, spent a few hours there and
received the paper we needed to get the keys.

Next step is to bring that paper to Herr Magdeburg, visit our space
with him (or someone else from Taekker), make a detailed description
and photos of the current state of the rooms, and then get the keys.

Finally that we need to get several insurances, a contract with the
electricity company, another one for the Internet, and start renovating.

We start paying rent May 16th.

Have a good weekend!

Just a quick note to say, tomorrow morning, 11:30am, is when we should finally be receiving our keys.

As part of the handoff, we will be taking record of the condition of the space, and a few other last bits of paperwork.

We'll drop you a line as soon as we're in to let you know the state of things (e.g., is there electricity yet?), and to send out an invite for the next meeting, the first in our new home!

Just dashing off a quick note to let you all know--keys have been transferred!

We spent the afternoon doing the Übergabeprotokoll (listing any known defects, etc.), and then waiting at Telekom to get an appointment for Internet installation (20. May).

The electricity is *on*, but there aren't many lights installed, so a night meeting might be tricky in the short term, unless maybe we all bring candles.  :)

I have to rush along to my German class now, but I'll send along a Doodle tonight to schedule our first meeting IN THE SPACE!

Finally, I have a moment to sit down and craft that email I promised you.

Let me first say I am super stoked that we are finally moving on to the next phase of our plan for world domination.  Everything feels much more real now that we're no longer shuffling papers and imaginary ideas, but instead have keys to come and go as we please.

So, that said, let's figure out when we can all meet up there!

Pick your favourite time

I'm favouring daylight hours because, as previously mentioned, the lighting situation is suboptimal at the moment, and I'm not sure how usable the space is at night yet.

Thanks again to everyone for all their help and energy in getting this crazy project rolling.  Let's build a community we can all be proud of.

I can't wait to see what happens when we're all settled in and making the space our own!

The masses have spoken once more (thanks for such quick replies!), and the next meeting will be...

Sunday, 10 May 2015, 1:00pm

at
Paul-Lincke-Ufer 44A, 2.Hof, Aufgang A, 1.OG

a.k.a.
Lacuna Lab

But of course we don't have to wait 'til Sunday to start things moving!  Like Séamus mentioned, there's plenty of clean-up to be done (dusting, wiping, sanding, painting, disinfecting...).

Séamus, aBe and I will be there from 1:00pm today, so feel free to drop on by.

I have to leave around 4:30pm for German class, but maybe aBe can stay longer if people are interested.

Until we get keys sorted out, one of us will try to be there as often as possible to facilitate "opening hours".  :)

By the way, here's my phone number, in case you need a more immediate medium than email:
0152 03748201

See you in the Space!

Sounds great! My mom is visiting so I may not be able to stop by before sunday. Will try my best though...

We're out running errands now, so hopefully no one is planning to drop by who hasn't already...

We'll have cleaning supplies on hand tomorrow, and might do a Bauhaus run, too.

More details later!

We'll be back working on the space again tomorrow. We can work in shifts throughout the day so check on this thread that someone will be there for you if/when you want to come along and help.

would be great if someone could help with a vacuum cleaner.

And we might think about little improvements on the vip room ;)

Looking pretty much forward to creating together a magical space!

1. Should we use hackpad instead of e-mail?

2. I saw a circular metal brush at ALDI for 15€ to be mounted in a
drill, to scratch paint away. I have a drill. I would wet the wall
before using such a tool to avoid breathing harmful paint dust. Should
we get such a brush?

3. Does anyone have goggles for protecting the eyes?

1. I just created lacunalab.hackpad.com.  Hooray, we now have a place for collaborative documents!  (Seriously, hackpad is great.  Didn't realize they were bought by Dropbox...)

2. That drill attachment sounds like a brilliant tool.  I was not looking forward to sanding the walls by hand.

3. I know Alex has one pair of goggles, and I was thinking to grab a few more cheap ones and masks for painting/bleaching protection.

Like Séamus mentioned, we plan to be in the Space again tomorrow from around 11, continuing work on the bleach party we started today.  I'll have to leave again at 16.30, but yes, working in shifts to get the place cleaned up would be super swell, if people are up for it.

Was good to see those of you who dropped by today!  Hope to see you all in the coming days!

Also, that sekt that I kept talking about not opening?  We're opening it on Sunday.  Bring a cup.  :)

Feeling pretty stressed about a couple of events this month so not much time right now unfortunately. But I will try and put in some time this weekend.

I am sorry that I havent made it to any of the meetings, but I realized that I am actually not in a place to get involved with this project, as beautiful as it does sound.
i look forward to experiencing the greatness that surely shall evolve out of it!
but for now, i guess you can remove me from this email list ;)
best of luck with all,

Just a quick note before bed to say THANK YOU for such an awesome day in the space today.

I'm seriously astonished at how much we were able to get down in such a short period of time, and it's a testament to the quality of our crew.

Can't wait to see what the coming days hold, as we transition from working *on* the space to working *in* the space.

Alex, Nayeli, and I will be there bright and early tomorrow morning, so come on by, or give us a call (0152 03748201).

And don't forget to take a look at and add stuff to the Hackpad I keep blabbing about!

This is so exciting. Big shout out to all of you for your hard work! I'm sorry to have missed the activities last week (I'm working more than full time atm). Hope to see some of you Tuesday and otherwise as we activate the space in the coming weeks. Whoop!
Hey beautiful people,

Alex, Nayeli, and I are here since 7am, and we got a first coat on the wall behind the kitchen sink before running out of paint.

So we'll need to make another Bauhaus run at some point if we want to finish the walls.

Though I was planning on staying the whole day through, I need to duck out at some point for errands.

Can we get a sense of who is planning to be around today, and when?
we are currently renovating our office - there is one full bucket of
white colour (Universalweiss von Bauhaus) left. Could you use that?
(It's at Luisenstraße close to Charité)

you can also call me at 0176 78408702

Hope to find some time this week to help you guys in the space - thanks
for all the work so far!
I have 2 painting rollers, buckets, brushes and some plastic sheets. Is this of help? Someone can pick them up from my house over the river shinkestrasse, my boyfriend is home. Otherwise I can bring tomorrow.
We're going to close up shop for now, since there's not so much to do without supplies.

Current plan is to meet up again at 13:30 at Bauhaus (Hasenheide) to buy more paint, then head back to Lacuna and use it.

Let us know via email or phone if and when you're able to join!

btw, i have a circular saw that might make it easier to cut the door or
anything else. i'm working out of home today but i can bring it tomorrow
morning if it's useful.
We're all heading out now. Got a few things at Bauhaus, including paint, so we can continue that project next time people gather.

No one will be around tonight, so let's just regroup tomorrow.

In thinking about to coordinate until we get keys figured out... Shall we just keep announcing who will be in when, or would people rather update a shared google calendar to mark when they're able to come in? I can set that up if people would find it useful.
I think the google calendar is useful.
I can be there tomorrow from around 2 pm.
If everything worked according to plan, you should have all received notifications about the email list and shared calendar I just created.

You should all be able to add events to the calendar too, so that should make it easier to coordinate who can come when, and we can plan our renovation plans accordingly.

Alex, Nayeli, and I spent more than a little time today just basking in the greatness that is our space--we've managed to turn it from a dark, dank cave into a bright and inviting workshop in around 48 hours!

Thanks again for all your help, and I look forward to seeing you all more this week!

It only gets better from here.
Sorry for flooding everyone's inboxes tonight, but if any of you *didn't* just receive an email from me titled "[Lacuna Lab] Email List and Shared Calendar", let me know.

Just want to make sure the mailing list is set up properly.
Just a quick note: if anyone wants to get in the space today, give Ramin a call at 0176 20504057.

He works just a few doors down from the space and can let people in on short notice.

Thanks Ramin!
I got a call from the insurance guy.

home 093122067
mobile 01718239666
wolfgangfries@web.de

He said it did not make much sense what the contract says about the
required insurances, and he only recommended hapflichtversicherung for
275€ a year, and that people should have their own insurance for
materials and laptops.

Could you maybe call him to find out how it compares to your contact?
I did not understand every detail about it...
Ok. I include Soma, Alex and James in the reply to keep them informed.

I didn't post this on the hackpad because it included contact information.
A friend has a spare desk and is asking, if somebody wants it. I don’t have a car. May anybody take it from Neukölln to Lacuna Lab? (Adress will follow).
Just a quick note to remind everyone that we start paying rent tomorrow, so it would probably help if we gave you all an IBAN to use, yes?  :)

DE58 4306 0967 1174 5008 00

That is the Lacuna Lab e.V. account to which you can pay your rent.  Remember: this month only half is due.  The first full month's rent will be due on the 1st of June.

Thanks again to everyone for helping turn the space into something bright and inviting!

And how about that video that aBe found of the previous tenants?  They set the bar for partying pretty high--hopefully you guys are up to the challenge for our Opening Party!

Also, a bunch of us will be at co.up all day tomorrow for a special edition of the Creative Code Jam, featuring the Berlin Science Hack Lab.  Hope to see you there!
is anyone going to be there today? i can pass by today and help with
anything that needs to be done. i'll probably have sometime during this
week but not sure.
Thanks, I think probably not, because we don't have paint nor ladders,
and we need those to continue.

I hope we get them soon.

BTW. someone offered paint (we got an e-mail). I think it's somewhere in
Mitte. If someone can pick it up... it should be on a past e-mail.
Hope you all had a nice weekend!  Soma here, with some thoughts on our final steps toward activating the space!  (Thanks Phoebe for that great phrase--I love it).

This email will be a longer one, but the content is all designed to be user-friendly, so strap in and let's do this.

And if you really only have time to read one thing, skip to the DOODLE.

Painting!
So far every wall has been covered in white at least once (except the lift room, which was looking pretty nice and white already).  We can do another coat or two in places where we really feel it's needed, but otherwise, next up is ceilings, and then floors.

I plan to stop by Bauhaus sometime tomorrow to pick up some paint for the ceiling, so we can start doing that as soon as tomorrow afternoon.  I figure we should do the ceilings before the floors, because gravity.

For the floors, aBe brought in some grey paint that's meant for roofing, but preliminary tests show that it should be fine for our floors, too.  The common wisdom for painting the floors seems to be three-step:
1) clean the floors. 
2) prime the floors with Tiefgrund (which we have already, and which requires 12 hours to dry).
3) paint the floors.

Once the ceilings and floors are done, I think we're pretty much ready to start moving things in!

I think it's not unreasonable to think that, if we all pitch in this week when we can, we could finish painting by the end of the week, and have everyone moved in by the end of the following week.  (We can coordinate a rental truck to make rounds and collect everyone's things, if that turns out to be worthwhile.)

Access!
I know the key situation is a major barrier to having the space feel like its truly ready and belongs to all of us, and the electronic door lock is one of my highest priorities.

In the meantime, though, Ramin has offered to be a keybearer during the day, since his office at IXDS is just a few doors down the street.  Give him a call if you want to get in anytime there's no one in the space.  His number is on that Hackpad I keep talking about.

Next steps!
One bit of news is that we should have Internet access in the space starting Wednesday.  Many thanks to Alex for taking that bit of paperwork on.

It would be really helpful if everyone could keep the calendar updated, at least for this week, so we know when people will be able to help with the cleaning and the painting.

I figure it would also be good to have another meeting next weekend, so we can all assess our progress together, start planning how to move things in (truck rental, etc.), how to organize maintenance of the space going forward, and also start ideas spinning about the inevitable Activation Party!

So, that said, it's time for another DOODLE.  Let us see when is the optimal time for us to convene. :)

Whew, OK, so I think that covered all the immediacies.  Let me know if there's another questions, comments, concerns, etc.

Eager to get everything finished up, and can't wait for the energy we'll all bring together into the activated space!

would be great if someone could support to get internet connection, as I will be out of town till thursday.

The Telekom guy will be coming on wednesday between 16:00 and 18:15. The Hauswart Bernd will be there, as well, to grant acces to the basement.
I went to Telekom to print out the Auftragsbestätigung, it is now in a basket in the kitchen area.

Best regards and thanks, see you soon.
Running late today.  ><   I'm heading to Bauhaus shortly to grab more paint, and will be in the space between 14:30 and 15:00.

If anyone gets there before then, and is itching for something to do, we can probably start prepping the floor of the former porn room (now the "corner office"? :) ) by vacuuming and mopping.  The white water-based paint that we've scattered everywhere comes up surprisingly easily with a little water and scrubbing (aBe and I were using sponges and steel wool).
Thomas and I are in the space now, painting the worst spots of the ceiling with a ladder we borrowed from the neighbors.

If anyone is around this evening to keep the train moving, that'd be great! :)

Unfortunately I have to leave for German class soon, but can come back at 20:30 if people are still around.
I'm in class now, but I left the keys with Thomas and Seamus.

If people are still there later after class, I can come back and keep working :)
I would appreciate it if Soma could open the doodle to allow other times than the weekends as I'm not in Berlin almost every weekend. Same goes for Rin and it would be awesome if team swocket could attend the meetings aswell!
We had a good day in the Space today, finishing up the yellowest spots on the ceiling.  Thanks to help from Sarah, Nayeli, Arturo, and Carolina, the painting is now almost completely done!

We also did a number on the bathroom areas, so, while they're still not *nice* yet, they hopefully look significantly cleaner than the last time you saw them. :)

The only white painting we have left is the space above the loft (which is primed and ready to be painted with our new thicker paint tomorrow), and the reddish wall in the corner office, which still has some red showing through two coats of white.

Arturo will be bringing one last 10L of white paint into the Space tomorrow morning.

Thomas had mentioned a sealing spray that might help us prep the red wall before a third coat?

Carolina and Arturo did a great job cleaning up the Lift Room today.  Assuming we don't paint the floors in there, I'd say it's pretty much ready for move-in!

Going Forward
The next undertaking, then, will be the floors.  We have some roof material that aBe bought, but we're not totally sure it's kosher for internal floors yet... In the meantime, we can continue cleaning and priming the floors.

So tomorrow we can start by using the thicker ceiling paint in the loft area (maybe after putting a drop cloth down?  That wood might be harder to clean paint from than the concrete floors...), and by cleaning the floors in the corner (porner) office.

Also, if anyone has any extra overhead lighting fixtures floating around, now would be a good time to bring them in and install them, while we've got our borrowed ladder.  :)

The Next Meeting
So far it looks like this weekend is not a great time for the next meeting, as most people can't make it.  I only favoured weekends because, historically, that's been the best time for people.

Would a weekday evening work better for people?  Let me know. :)

Lacuna Activation is imminent.
Another good day in the space.  This report will be short, though, because I am very tired.

Switched my German classes to mornings, so I will be able to stay later in the evenings now.  This is a big part of why I am very tired.

Sarah and Jemma did a ton of touch-up work in the kitchen and entry areas today, and things are looking pretty spiffy.  Séamus and I got the ceiling and walls of the loft area, so there's spiffiness there, as well.

Arturo and Carolina cleaned up (thoroughly!) the floors in the corner office, and Séamus did the last bit of exorcism on the animal print (photographic evidence below).  Jemma also primed the seeping-red wall, so tomorrow we should be able to give it its (hopefully) final coat of paint.

Sadly, the Telekom technician never showed up, so we are still without Internet.  :(

We're actually approaching a point where the next steps are preferential and non-obvious, which is why I thought it would be good to get everyone together at once, to discuss preferences, visions, subcommittees, etc.

I've added a few more options to the Doodle for weeknight times, so hopefully we can achieve a quorum.  Please go ahead and update your availability so we can get the next meeting scheduled!

That's all for now.  We still need light fixtures. :P
Only three of us were signed up today, and since there's only one wall left to paint and a few floors to mop, and since the weather is beautiful, we figured we could call it a day off and have a picnic.

No specific plans on where/when yet, but if you're game to join, give me a call!
Regarding our next meeting: So far there's a tie between tomorrow afternoon and Wednesday evening for 7 people. Tomorrow would be preferable so we can move forward with things but maybe we can get more than 7 people some day next week. We're still missing some entries in the doodle.
I def can not tomorrow afternoon. Def can Wednesday. Just added myself to calendar.
I would come on Wednesday - tomorrow I would have to leave early.

Can I tell our members, that there are two meetings tomorrow and on Wednesday?
I also vote for 2 meetings. 
there is only one problem-
Abe can't attend on any of the two.
FYI, my phone, a.k.a. mobile office, has been malfunctioning for some reason--apologies if I've missed any calls or texts from you.  Going to Vodafone today to see what's wrong.

I'm a fan of the two-meeting plan, because with the two most popular dates combined, we can get everyone into the space, which will be good for debate, information dispersal, and for administrative things, like making sure everyone has signed a contract for the space and is an official member of the e.V.

That said, the next two "sub"-meetings will be:
Hello to everyone from Spain 

I just wanted to send some info about the current money situation (since
I'm the only one with access to online banking for now).

Our rent for May is 1.048,39€, which was due May 16th.

From that amount, Lacuna Lab's bank account has received 700€ from
Cyborgs e.V, Arturo, Carolina, Nayeli, Aurelia, Soma, Jem, Ramin, aBe &
Sarah.

We still need 348.39€ to cover May's rent, and next week we should
already pay June.

That's all the moN€w$ for now.
Sunny (cool) greetings from the South!
It was mentioned in the e-mail titled "Lacuna Lab : Rent" from May 16th.

For May we pay half the normal monthly rent. That means that each
Lacunan also pays half of whatever they normally would pay (150 => 75 or
100 => 50).
Just a quick one. Some people were finding the Hackpad a bit hard to make sense of. I've volunteered to be an editor of sorts, i.e., to keep the information as clear and concise as possible.

Please go to our new Start Here Hackpad and let me know if things are in anyway still unclear and I'll fix it for you. Otherwise keep adding all your wonderful ideas in there.
just so i don't forget the link this evening on the meeting:

it's not super big but i think it should be enough, in any case i think we all live near lacuna so we can even do several trips if we need.

it's 25€ for the whole day, let's talk it later but i'd rent it for the full day on sunday and move everything. 
So for the people who weren't at today's meeting Aurelia, Thomas and I presented Trello as a way to manage tasks and projects for Lacuna Lab. Here are some of the advantages we saw:

    Decisions and discussion happening out in open (comments)
    Clear overview of tasks and who is doing them
    Members can be assigned to tasks
    We can all work with it remotely
    Discussion about tasks is no longer in your inbox
    Keeping overview of votes on whether or not to do things
    Remote voting
    Deadlines, if we want them
    Linking to external docs
    Smooth conversion of meeting points into tasks


The biggest drawback is having to use "yet another tool" but in fact Trello will become your point of entry for everything. We'll still use Hackpad for reference and persistent documents but those will be linked to from Trello.

You should have received an email giving you access by now. If you have any trouble getting access and seeing our board, let me know.
Just a quick note before bed to thank everyone for their work at and between both parts of our special two-part meeting series.  Special thanks to Séamus, Aurelia, and Thomas for organizing our electronic hive-brain.

Seriously, check out the work they did seeding our Trello board--suddenly the space seems that much more manageable.

We'll have the last of the painting done by this weekend, and then it's time to rent a truck and move in!  Everyone who wants to share the truck and move some stuff in with us should follow the instructions on this card here.

Once we know who wants what where when, we can solve the Traveling Salesman problem and start building our workspace in earnest.

Looking forward to the next stage of Lacuna Activation!

(And I promise that sekt is coming soon.)
as I told today I would like to schedule the Cyborgs e.V. meeting every 3rd and 17th of the month. Before I announce that and put it into the calendar please tell me, if you are fine with that.

I’d love to announce our „bring a chair“-party for Wed June 3rd to our members.
I've been looking at kleinanzeigen for some cheap ceiling lights, as in less than 10 EUR. I was imagining them to be placeholders, or a basis for something creative, unless they were actually nice. I've already taken action on some lights, and some are still pending. I'd appreciate your feedback - just look at the trello page on lighting
and click on the links. Please let me know your opinions on the trello page. If some of you can easily pick up some lamps, please mention that as well.
I just added a NEW label (blue) to have a quick and dirty visual indicator for tasks that were added after a meeting and have not yet been discussed there (see SC_Design -> documentation concept).

If you find it useful use it :) if not we can skip it again.
we got good news from our friends at telekom. A techniker is coming tomorrow from 12:00 to 4:00!

So it looks good that everything is set up and we finally can work from our new place.
There's a relaxed hangout tonight I go to regularly and I thought I
might share it with you, I'd be happy to meet some of you there:

It's happening in Oppelner Straße 12 at Alelier Äuglein 8pm. ( for you,
who are not on facebook! )
I invited you to slack- a convenient chat thingy
 
It's not mandatory to use it (no important decisions only made there or something) but useful and fun.

if you missed the invitation, want another mail address to be invited  or have another question- - tell me.
we now have an established internet connection. Access data is on the bottom of the router until we change the ssid and password.
awesome! So that means we have a house phone number as well? Some of us yesterday had the brainwave that once we have the internet/phone, those without keys can call to see who's at the space. do we already have a phone?
Has there been discussion of when the space will be open later on today? Have plans to walk a few loads over with Phoebe between 5-7 (I believe she gets off work around 4). Would love to know when the space plans to be open so we can try our best to come by then. Thanks!
not sure if you got my groupmail, i didnt.

the transporter is fully packed and at lacuna soon.
if you have time and can be here kindof soon- please come around to unload it for its 2nd tour.

from the lacuna headquarter.
Hey, we are next on the list after arriving to lacuna so we need to stay
here to wait for them but if nobody else can make it i guess we can go
there and try to come back before they arrive to our place.
unfortunately NOW I got the message, that the desk can be taken from Neukölln today 1845 or later from Michael Karek, Hermannstr. 161, +49 177 3064400

I already sent a SMS to Wischi. If there is an evening tour, it would be nice, if you could take it from there. The desk can be used by anyone who likes to. Michael also offers some moving boxes if someone is interested. Please tell him/me if you like to drive there.

Can’t be there myself. Of course I will bring the desk another time, if it doesn’t fit your schedule today.
Nice find on the phone!

Just waiting at Fichtestraße 32 for the next tour, then will spent the early evening in the space helping people move, clean, etc.  Whatever needs doing.  :)
It's hard to see the chairs in those photos.
Are they chairs made of bamboo? We were thinking today of finding
chairs that can be easily stacked or folded for storage. Maybe from
one of those shops that sells material from renovating / closing
businesses.
I’ve just been at the space, awesome work with the toilet, thumbs up! 
Beautiful is maybe not the right word, but it looks pretty decent in white! :)

CAN’T WAIT TO USE IT.
thanks for the work!
Question: Have we figured out how to figure out who sits where yet …?

I might not be entirely up to date on this, because I’ve been out of town the weekend.

wischi brought a desk to the lab, but we have no idea how the final space allocation will be (so the orange standing desk in the Lift room is a suggestion, not a “claim” or anything).
had a discussion with Abe and the SC yesterday. I think the chairs might be fine as long we have too few. We can kick them out later, if we don’t like them anymore and have better stuff.

A friend wants to rent a „Robbe“ and bring the desk from Neukölln and the Conference table and the chairs from Prenzlauer Berg. For this I need a decision, if we want that stuff.

That could be an opportunity if anyone still has to move some things. I will tell you the date as soon as I know it.
the second key is still with the metal workers. Do we need the ladder for longer, or shall we return it?

Our Hausmeister Bernd just passed by and brought us two more keys.

Best regards and a nice and sunny afternoon.
It would be nice to use the ladder for putting up lighting. Would be nice if we could keep it at least till the end of this week, and then we might need to borrow it again...
I want to experiment with drawing and painting machines, but I would
rather build something myself. Here some inspiration (777 videos of
drawing machines!):
Things are developing nicely as some of us start to use the space and do some furnishing here and there. As a more concerted effort, Claudine is leading the installation of light fixtures tomorrow and our textiles experts, Nayeli and Sarah, will be going to the market to buy fabric and fittings for curtains in the main and end rooms. BUT they can't do it alone! Jump in on Trello here and here to coordinate with both projects.
A friend offers me this for 30€.

It's like what we are using, but a bit shorter.
6 steps instead of 8. It can be assembled in one
long piece, but that would not work in the middle
of the room, only for high walls.

What do you think?
Looking at similar models (3 x 6), they are 4.5 meters high. Our ceiling
is about 4.2. I thought it would not work, but the ceiling has metal
beams, and the ladder can rest on them, so I would say it's enough. I
guess we can try. We should pick it up near Kotti.
yes, I have a desk in Neukölln and a conference table + 8 chairs in Prenzlauer Berg. For the chairs and the table we haven’t decided yet, if we want it, so @all please tell me your opinion.
Wanted to send out an official invitation to join us this coming Monday evening 8pm for our very first Design & Publication subcommittee meeting. We'll start by inviting everyone to fill out their current + projected visions for the Lacuna brand. If you can't come and still want to share your thoughts, not to worry! Fill out the sheet attached and send back to us-we'll​ be sure to add your thoughts to the discussion. There are also several things to take a look at if you're so inclined on Trello (add comments if you have them to the Google pres re: positioning, vales, etc.)
Is it possible that you could save me a space somewhere in the big main or end room?  I don't have any desk or furniture to move in as yet to hold the spot and am swamped with work and lots of travel this month so its all a bit much.

Looking forward to seeing how the space has evolved!
Not sure who's around this weekend. Did you get your key so you can get in?

Anyway, there are tasks to "pick up". Replacing the toilet and tiling the toilet is a big job for multiple people. Still some work to be done on the toilet door (we need that 1cm x 5cm x 200cm piece and two simple door handles to complete this). Don't know if Claudine's doing any lighting this weekend or if Nayeli and Sarah are doing any curtains?

There are other things we need like small mattresses and more palettes to build couches for the lounge if people have those available.

Anyway, have a look on Trello.
after a long and productive meeting yesterday the SC_Design & Identity group decided to go for its own trello board due to the the huge amount of work and tasks that have to be handled here in the next future. Feel free to join the discussion there. The old SC list on the main trello board will remain there to give a short overview of what is being worked on at the SC board. See the results of our brandstorm here. If you want to contribute your vision as well do it there (with the help of the brandstorm sheet given to you in our previous mail).

You can also now follow the meeting notes of the SC on a separate hackpad.
This week started the School of Machines, Making and Make Believe
(http://schoolofma.org). I'm one of the main instructors in this 10 week
program, so I'll be at NK most mornings.

I also haven't managed to finish the web project, and for some reason,
our Telekom internet connection does not allow me to log into the
project server, so I'm working at home. Arturo and I already had issues
accessing our mail servers, and that was fixed. Since the project is
very urgent now and I don't know how long it would take to fix this
issue, I'm finishing the project at home.

I'll be back soon!
who is the owner of the projector and can we use it for movie screenings? We think about starting our first meeting on June 17 with a cyborg movie. Of course Lacuna Lab members can attend, too, but we haven’t decided about the movie yet.

Best, Enno

Copyright warning: Whenever you plan to watch movies on the projector it always has to be non-public. Never put an public announcement on a website or facebook and tell people that a movie and which one is shown. German copyright laws even don’t care about taking no admission fee. But of course there can be guests who doesn’t need to be member of Lacuna Lab or Cyborgs e.V. just like you can have guests in your living room. And  you can announce a meeting without telling that a movie is shown.
Yes, thank you so much to the toilet and tile replacement crew!  The bathroom looks amazing, almost unrecognisable from when we first moved in!   Awesome work!!! 
Greetings from the Northern Wilds of Wisconsin, USA!

Writing this email has been on my mind for a while, since I wanted to congratulate us all on bringing our space to life.

We did it!

Lacuna Lab is now a living, breathing entity, and I can't wait to see how it starts to grow up!

It was definitely difficult for me to have to leave for vacation right after move-in, but it's been good to unplug and reflect on what we've accomplished over the past six months.  I've actually ended up extending my time in the US, and won't be back in Berlin until 22 June.  After relaxing and spending some time with family, I'm already feeling re-energized to come back and help Lacuna enter its adolescence. :)

Growing Pains

I imagine we are now in a sort of "growing pains" period, as we jostle for position and decide how to use each part of the studio.  I know Rin, Jem, and others have already expressed concerns about reserving personal space.  It's been an ongoing question the entire time we've had the studio, and it's one that we couldn't answer effectively until we got everyone's desks and equipment physically inside.

I've been hoping that we can avoid being too prescriptive about this.  That is, I would prefer not to have mandates like "each full-time member is allowed 10qm for personal belongings, blah blah blah..."

We should all just remember that we volunteered to join this boat together, and so should maintain an attitude of mutual respect and open-mindedness as we shuffle furniture around (since it's unlikely we'll get everything perfect on the first try).

I encourage everyone to voice their concerns and desires for the space either via email or the Trello boards, so that we can be sure to optimize for everyone who has helped make the dream of Lacuna a reality.

One point in particular I noticed people talking about after move-in is that many of us would like to maintain access to the "roof patio" through the Lift Room window, since it is a very nice and unique benefit to the space, particularly during these lovely summer months.  I'm sure we can work out a configuration that is beneficial for everyone there.

The Next Milestones

So hopefully everyone is getting nicely settled and making the space feel like home.  :)

Major kudos to Thomas and Alex (and anyone else who was involved in the project) for upgrading the bathroom.  It looks brand new!  I have to second aBe's comment, that this probably the most excited I've ever been about a toilet. :P

I hope people are thinking about the next improvements they'd like to see in the space (like kitchen seating?), and also about the internal and external activation parties!  The amazing work we've all done deserves to be celebrated, first amongst ourselves, and then with Berlin at large!  Let's start considering how we'd like to demonstrate the values of Lacuna to the world.

That's all for now--time to go soak up some sun with the brother I haven't seen in almost three years.
The projector belongs to me, and you are welcome to use it!  I ask only that you treat it with care, and please return it to its case and hiding spot when you're done.

And don't forget to put your event on the shared Lacuna calendar so people can be aware of when the space will be in use!

Thanks for the note about copyright--definitely important for us all to keep in mind as we make event announcements, so we can stay on the right side of the law.  :)
Today I wanted to invite a friend of mine to join tomorrows' cyborgs meeting. I was pretty surprised when he reinvited me to the same event location for his lecture series on non-human subjectives.

After talking to some members of Lacuna it seems as noboby knows what's going on. This is problematic in a few ways.

The space is still under construction. This means we aren't really prepaired for public events. There are no lockers or anything like that where people can lock there stuff. There is also still a lot of construction waste and work left. Additionally we do not have enough chairs for bigger groups.

In general there is nothing wrong about having events in the space organized by cyborgs e.V. but people have to be informed in adcance to be prepaired.

I for myself thought the current meeting was a cyborgs members only meeting. It was not transparent to me that there might be 30 or 40 people in the space on Wednesday.

It's not about cancelling the current meeting but about a better communication. And please keep in mind that the space has not even been opened for public events ;)

Good luck with tomorrows meeting anyway & all Lacunas members don't forget to prepair!
for normal, our meetings seldom have more then 10 attendees, mostly fewer. It’s a member meeting but announced on our website for people who want to get in touch with us. For normal 1-2 guests (or future members) show up. I really would be very surprised, if it would get bigger. We also had bigger events when we invite known people like Tim Cannon, but there isn’t any such event planned. Let’s see how it works out tomorrow and discuss it then, ok?
I don't have a lot of time to jot off anything but a quick email right now, but I wanted to at least say that I second Thomas' concerns.

Lacuna Lab is a shared resource, and effective use of it necessitates mutual respect and communication.  The space is, first and foremost, Lacuna.  No one member has any more rights to it than any other.  That is to say, intended usage of the space should be clearly communicated well in advance to all other members.

As I mentioned in my last email, we are still in the process of activating the space, and until all internal members are comfortable with the current state of our rooms and equipment, inviting the public into our space without clear communication is disrespectful and, especially given our current lack of insurance coverage, potentially dangerous.

Apologies in advance if I am in any misinterpreting the emails, as there is only so much insight I can have from the other side of the planet.

My only wish is to ensure that our association maintains a healthy culture of comfort and mutual respect, especially in these early days, as that culture will determine the success or failure of our dreams for the studio.
since you seem to be Lacuna's resident night owl, was just wondering if you are at lacuna tonight. I'm just considering whether to stop by on my way from the airport with my bag o foam mattress and curtains. thanks!
The chair situation has not changed. I guess we could have a few more
around the large table in the open space.

Things in my mind about tomorrow:

Are there preparations needed?

We have standing wood pieces that can fall, paint buckets,
construction stuff and tools laying around.

We have no drinks (only tap water).

There's cables that may be unsafe, for instance one next to the main
entrance. We could tape it for tomorrow.

I made the elevator door lockable. Not safe against "determined
adversaries", but works otherwise.

We don't have any instructions yet for events, but obviously the place
should be left in the same condition as before (including the
toilette), no smoking, guests should use the freifunk connection, not
the Lacuna one (I haven't tested if the freifunk connection works).

We don't have curtains to block light, so projecting at early hours
won't work very well. I'm not sure we have speakers.

Anything else I'm forgetting?

Even if things are not so ready I hope it's a great event tomorrow!
The owner told me we could go tomorrow between 10 and 12 in the morning
to pick it up, or between 4 and 5 pm.

Anyone up for that? A 1 km walk with a big piece of wood?

We could write something in it to greet people in the street 
I brought some stuff to the pad tonight - because of the coolio cyborg talk I couldn't just plop stuff in the places I wanted to, so just a heads up over email.

I brought a stack of curtains which are currently in the kitchen. Feel free to take and use what you want. Plus I brought more kitchen towels. 

I also brought over a foam mattress - I figured it might be useable for the pallet couch if we make that. It's currently in the huge red luggage.
It was very nice to see so many people today watching a presentation
about cyborgs and discussing at Lacuna Lab. It was a strange feeling
too. I was wondering how is it to come to this place for an hour or two,
without knowing anything about all the work that has gone into making it
possible 
I agree. It was a really nice and interesting meeting. Everyone was kind to each other and respectful to the space. All the stuff that was used should be back in place more or less.

This feels like another step into the right direction.

Thanks for sharing the pics aBe!
me and rin are in lacuna. we only borrowed the space keys from alex so have to get out of the area around 10? somebody knows something about the house, area opening times or can come around with a key?

do we have a doc for keyholders? its good to know who has the house/area keys, no?
Yes, a doc or whatever is handiest for everyone to know who the current key holders are, what their "normal" hours are and how they can be contacted  is needed. If you have want to set it up? :)

To my knowledge it's:
aBe
Arturo - early bird
Marcel - night owl
Metalworkers as insurance for their ladder (we will probably give the ladder back, and get our key back, when we finish hanging our lights so there's an incentive to finish that)

Sounds like you might need one too, Ramin? Anyone else had trouble getting access? There's a Trello card for that :)
leider konnte ich Dich telefonisch nicht erreichen.

 

Erst einmal wünsche ich Dir alles erdenklich Gute zum Geburtstag und feiere schön!!

 

Die Rhion Versicherung hat zur Vereinshaftpflichtversicherung bzgl. der Veranstaltungen noch die unten genannten

Fragen (ggf. müsste ansonsten für Veranstaltungen jeweils eine Haftpflichtversicherung abgeschlossen werden).

Das Angebot zur Inhaltsversicherung habe ich dann heute morgen auch noch erhalten (siehe Anhänge). Trotz der Nachlässe halte ich die Prämie (liegt u.a. wohl an der Einstufung als Vereinsheim) für recht hoch; ich müsste also nachverhandeln (geht aber erst, wenn die Sicherungsbeschreibung vorliegt) oder werde den Vorgang nächste Woche bei anderen Gewerbeversicherern über einen Maklerpool ausschreiben.
Meant to say a big thank you for this. I did a prototype curtain wire that needs to be replaced. I bought proper curtain hooks. Can do it next week or whatever. Also made a first attempt couch with your foam mattress up in the loft. It's too high now but we just remove a palette or two for maximum relaxation pose.
for the room where we are we bought a plastic tube at bauhaus, it's
meant to be used to pass wires through it but it works well for the
curtains if they are not very heavy. It's 2€ for 2m and you can join one
after another if you need something longer.
Joana Moll - http://janavirgin.com/, an artist and activist from
Barcelona who was teaching at the School of Machines, Making and Make
Believe (where I teach for 10 weeks), saw our studio during her visit to
Berlin.

She liked it very much and asked if there's any chance she could work
with us during August and part of September.

She would need a chair and a place for her laptop. She's really nice and
friendly.

Should we discuss in a meeting if we are open to temporary members?
I guess over the next week things will happen with the overhead lighting, so if you have your own ideas of how this should be done but haven't checked out that card, please read what's happening on the Trello

The way I see it, it's not necessarily going to be the perfect lighting solution, but it will be a lighting solution, a solution you can build on or alter as you wish in the future. Also, we will also have floor and desk lighting. Bear in mind the cost of all the lamps have come out of my own pocket. Since all of this is a volunteer effort we vote with our feet so to speak. If you have some awesome idea to make a lamp out of cups, great, please do it. And please add it to the Trello. 

Let's get something up so we can return the ladder to our neighbors. We need a case of beer - who's in charge of that?
since we all have to work for money from time to time I thought I ask around:

Is there anyone with descent knowledge and references in web based interactive product presentations in WebGL or similar techniques?

I would need a link to a webpage with some past projects and a short description about you and your skills.

There is a good possibility to work on a project for this Munich based agency.
But since I've been working non stop since January,
I'll take time off until September. Anyway I'm still
teaching in Potsdam and at the School of Ma,
so it's not really vacation 
I think something we do need to address as soon as possible (in the next meeting perhaps?) is whether we will be taking on new members, and if so when, part-time or full-time, short-term (residencies) etc.  Because there are a lot of great people we have the opportunity to bring into the space, but it’s all very unclear where things stand on that for the moment.
I’m not sure if you got more responses than just Marcel (perhaps he was the only response that was cc’ed to the whole group?), but if you still can, please do go ahead with getting these chairs! Everyone in Lacuna that I’ve discussed it with so far has given it a thumbs-up. 
Too bad ... I thought I had sent you an email as well, but it seems I didn't ... Anyway, in terms we can wish for something :) I think we should have chairs similar to those in the attachment. They are much easier to store and use a lot less space.
I had the impression that the ones initially offered were of better
quality and more comfortable than the ones in the picture. I'm not sure
I'd like to sit 7 hours (duration of a Jam) in one of them. Do you think
it would work?
Hope you have all been happily working away.
I am finally back in Berlin (for a few days) and I have some showings of my work coming up this week if you are interested.

Thursday evening is the grand farewell for Supermarkt - an events and coworking space on Brunnenstrasse - with an audio visual performance from Peter Kirn and I.
An impromptu offering. Sarah asked if Joa and I could hold a short performance/open rehearsal of our Jazz duo in Lacuna tomorrow at around 15h. It's about 30 minutes of music. Guitar and singing. Relaxed stuff. We could close the door to the lift room to minimise disturbance if needed. But if it's too much of an intrusion generally, just let me know. It was just a nice spontaneous idea.
Just wanted to send a quick note to say I've been missing seeing everyone in the space! Although I'm in Berlin, I expect to be busy through August due to School of Ma. If there are any prospective additions needing a desk space for this period, please connect them with me and we can discuss an arrangement!

Hope to run into you all here and there,
Turns out we were too spontaneous even for ourselves: We're actually too busy to do the open rehearsal today. But we can do it on Sunday at 4pm as long as that doesn't clash with any other plans and doesn't disturb anyone. Let me know if there's any problem.
Yeah, new members is sounding like something we should discuss at the next all-hands meeting, which we're probably about due for, so we can discuss other things, including but not limited to:

    how are things going since move-in?
    lingering tasks to close out
    internal / external activation events!

It also sounds like, being summer, a lot of Lacunans are in and out of Berlin in the coming weeks.  I'd like to send out a Doodle to plan the next meeting, but it might be helpful if we could get a sense of when people will be around to attend: could people update the Google Calendar with their known upcoming travel dates, so we can rule out dates that are obviously suboptimal?

Loving hanging out in the space now that it's alive, and looking forward to seeing you all in the coming days!
Hey there, thanks Soma! Much appreciated.
I plan to be in Lacuna Saturday and Sunday morning and early afternoon (from 10 am onwards, till 4 pm?), I might come in tonight to continue to disconnect lamps from the rods.
The browser is still our favorite place to see art, so these five
Microgrants of $500 will be awarded to artists to create new
browser-based artworks.

This program is run as an open call. Submissions comprise a simple
150-word statement and a single sketch or image. Upon the close of the
open call, the proposals will be considered by a special jury, with five
Microgrants awarded.

Awardees will be announced in early August, and the resulting artworks
will be integrated into Rhizome's 2015-2016 program.
Yeah if we are going to go down the road of letting others "take over" our membership for a few months I would be interested in talking about options.
Unfortunately I haven't had time to get into the space and most of summer is looking like it will be like that :(
Hey, so I was a bit too ambitious with regards to when I would be at Lacuna - If I come today it would be after 4 pm.

I think the idea for the lighting is now well developed, so I invite you in the coming days to do something to help make it a reality, whether it is cutting cable lengths, or drilling holes in the ceiling.

Please check the Trello for details.
On Tuesday, right after Angelo got back from Hongkong/China, we pitched at an event for the accelerator of Deutsche Bahn. And we won a slot in their 3 month accelerator program! \o/ We already celebrated at Lacuna with some Sekt and Ramin, but we’re totally up for a second round of Sekt when more of you guys are around :).

Anyway, with the accelerator program come 3 months of free coworking at betahaus, which we don’t need but probably should use. So in July, August and September you might not see us at Lacuna that often during the day. But don’t worry – our office and our heart :) is still at Lacuna. We’d love to setup the hardware hacking corner soonish!

Feel free to have a Tsing tao on us, there are some in the fridge!
As aBe noted in another email, there is not much information on the work
we intend to develop during /Pala Fruits/ in the documentation I shared
with him. In a nutshell: we have been looking at an array of different
sensors (humidity, vibration, presence, movement...) as to pick up
changes in the environment and human interaction. The arduino would be
in turn connected to a computer running Ableton Live, transforming the
inputs of the various sensors into different audio broadcasts. Thus, for
example, triggering an audio response when the plant will be exposed to
human speech, in effect forming a sort of dialogue between it and the
person interacting. Among other things, I see this as an experience on
communication.
from July, 17th on I am searching for a reliable person who wants to live in my room for at least four weeks. The apartment is in Hermannstr. 233 in Neukölln. There are three more people living in. The room is 23 sq m, has a balcony, costs 320 Euro and is fully furnished. Contact me if you want to have more details.

Do you know anyone who is interested in renting my room?
Sure, I will suggest. :) To obtain a Lab key, we have to pay a 40 eur deposit that we get back when we return the key and we sign a contract. We could extend this contract to include a haus/hof key as well, and increase the deposit at minimum to the cost of cutting these haus/hof keys. Or simply draw up a completely new contract.
There were at least 2 keys, i think, at the beginning and then 3 more
that the landlord brought. the people who have those haven't had to pay
anything for them so it's probably more fair if we pay the keys among
everyone as Claudine says?

Whatever it is i would like to have one too, i don't mind either way but
let me know, i can bring you the money to the studio later in the
evening if you are going to be there.
@Claudine: I like the idea of updating the key holder agreement to account for Hof Keys, only thing is that not everyone wants a Hof Key so we probably still need two separate agreements and security deposits for each type of key.

@Wischi: I also considered that someone leaving the space could simply sell their Hof Key to a person joining (assuming that the leaving and joining coincide) but then considered that it's important that we keep track of who has each Hof Key for security, and in any case we need signed key agreements.

Generally regarding costs of key cutting, I would propose that this is a Lacuna expense, and that people need only pay security deposits. Which would mean we could a) consider all of the original €48 paid for the Lab key to be a security deposit that is refundable or b) already pay back the €8 and Soma (who originally paid for the cutting) files the key cutting as an expense.

@Arturo: Regarding the number of Hof keys. Yes, I remember this. So do we have 4, 5 or 6 Hof keys currently? And would the holders mind updating the Trello card and spreadsheet so we know.

@Marcel: Thanks a million for sorting out the permission for new Hof keys!
How to do all this: I think the members that spend time in Lacuna should decide who gets to be temporary resident. So not AirBNB-Style the person who isn't there rents out their place. I'd rather compare it to a flatshare where you say "Hey flatmates I'm gonna be gone for two months!" and then they decide who they want to share the flat with for the time you're gone. Of course you can suggest someone. Does that makes sense for you?
Odd that it's a slow process. When I made such insurance for home I did
the whole thing in an hour at Dresdner Bank, and they didn't ask for so
many details.

That window was broken already when we moved in. We accepted the space
as it was so I wonder why would Tækker want to do anything about it now.
Just a reminder that we're gathering at the space today to catch up on status of things and figuring out next steps for various projects (logo, lighting, etc...).

And at 19:30 we've got an all-hands meeting to review our progress and vote on remaining action items and catch everyone up.

Come on by when you can!
Thanks to Thomas and Alex for returning the loaned ladder back downstairs with beer. We still have need for a ladder for renovations, and I think it would come in handy in the future for whenever we set up installations, and so it would make sense for us to invest in one ourselves. Soma said he scoped out a baumarkt and saw one for about 100 EUR. Chances are we will have access to a vehicle on Thursday and could easily buy and transport a ladder to Lacuna at that time. So, what do you all think about this? 

I did not add this to the Trello voting board because last night we decided what we vote on, and it did not include purchases like this.
Thanks for the initiative. Dunno, I think while we are in renovation mode, wood is still useful - we might want to build under counter shelves, more tables, maybe the wood is good for art projects. I think the wood is small enough to put outside ourselves, without bringing it to a waste center. 
It still available!

I think 80€ is a good price, it was about 3 times more expensive in the
shop I believe.

It's about 15 minute walk to Reuterplatz, in case 2 people want to carry
it by foot. I have back pain today 

Or if we are going to pick it up by car (does it fit?) we should call
the person today and say when we will be there.
noticed too late. The ad is now gone. We have a paper with the name,
object, price, date. I could print the e-mail in which I asked if it was
available and he replied, but it does not include the price.
A friend of mine that is also an animator, may be interested in join us too.
I was planning to talk about it on the meeting on sunday, but at the end we couldn't make it.
Should I put his name on the waiting list in trello?
Yeah, we could do that. I think in an ideal situation, we'd have another Lacuna Swing soon to make the furniture in the common areas that would be made out of this wood - I mainly am thinking about under counter shelves, and maybe we could make a nice office supplies and printer area. Then whatever is left is for art projects, and we can give people a week to pull out wood they want to use, and then the rest is dumped.
What can be done so this never happens again?
Big sign on the door? With a check list, like on airplanes?

When I've left I've closed windows, switched off all the power strips to
avoid useless power consumption, turned off the lights and fans and
locked the door. Should we write those on a big paper?

Also make sure the fridge door is closed. It wasn't a few days ago.

One more: someone left the elevator unlocked. That means that anyone
could enter through the elevator. There's a lock at the bottom of the
elevator door which must be inserted down so the door can't be opened
from the outside. It's hard to lock it, but it's doable.
Happy Summer!  Hope you're out enjoying the fact that the sun is back for a bit.

It's been a while since we've sent out a proper newsletter-type email, and there's plenty to talk about, so let's get started.

Lacuna Swing
On Sunday, 12 July, we had our first official Lacuna Swing event, where a bunch of us gathered around lunchtime and started picking random tasks to clean up and improve the space.

It was a great success!

Check out photos of the shelving we put up in the Main Room, and the new sitting area in the Kitchen.  We cleaned out a lot of the junk under the loft area as well.

It was a great chance for us to all work together and get the space that much closer to feeling "finished and furnished", so much so that we decided to have one every other Sunday to keep the ball rolling and get Lacuna from "beta" to "production ready".

Of course attendance is purely voluntary, but the more people we have, the more energy builds up, and the more we can get done (and there's still a few things to get done, like lighting, kitchen storage, shower cleanup...).

So I hope to see all of you at the next Lacuna Swing on Sunday, 26 July!


All-Hands
The evening of the Swing we also had an All-Hands meeting, where we discussed important topics, like the process for accepting new members to the space, some basic rules for the space, voting procedures, Satzung changes, and many others.

As always, you can catch up with the notes from the meeting here, and I definitely encourage those who weren't at the meeting to take a look.


Show + Tell
In addition to the Swing, we've been trying another recurring event out: a weekly show-and-tell every Monday evening at 19:30.  It's an opportunity to update other Lacunans about what you're working on, and get to know your fellow spacemates by sharing some pizza and a beer together.

You can check out who showed what at the Show + Tell Notes.

We also plan to use the show-and-tell as a way to introduce new members to the space (and vice versa).

And again, naturally not everyone will always be able to attend, but it's a great mechanism to keep the cultural heartbeat of Lacuna going, so do try to come by when you can, and don't be shy about sharing what you've been up to!


Open Windows
As Marcel mentioned yesterday, one of the windows was left open after everyone had left the space, which is a flagrant and avoidable danger to the well-being of our space.  As he also mentioned, we are not yet insured, so we would have ZERO recourse if any of our precious equipment went missing.

And even if we were insured, it's simply an unnecessary risk--the success or failure of our space is directly tied to how safe and comfortable people feel there.

So please, when leaving the space, think of your fellow Lacunans (and your own gear!) and make sure everything is in a consolidated state, just like the sign on the door suggests: Windows, Lights, Locks.


Lacuna Lab Lives!
On Tuesday, 13 July we hosted a field trip to Lacuna Lab for the students of the School of Making, Machines, and Make-Believe.  Check out a photo on the Lacuna Lab Twitter account.

And while aBe and I taught six School of Ma students how to connect their computers with Processing and OSC, the space was alive with creative pursuits: Nayeli was sewing her bags, Ramin was soldering for an upcoming children's workshop, Anaisa and Alex were working in the Porner Room, Thomas was prototyping an art installation in the Underloft...

It was really amazing to see our vision for a co-creation space come to life, a buzzing hive of artistry.  It warmed my heart.  :)


Internal Activation Party
And last, but obviously not least, our Internal Activation Party!

We've all done some amazing work together to transform the abandoned factory floor we initially rented into the space we share today, and I for one think that's something worth celebrating.

At the All-Hands we decided on a date: Friday, 31 July--two weeks from today!

The event is meant as an internal celebration of our efforts, and as such is intended more for Lacuna members than the general public, but don't let that keep you from inviting a few close friends who you think would appreciate how cool what we're doing is!

And this time, I promise, the sekt will flow.


Whew, that was a long one, but that's all for now.  Thanks for reading, and for making the dream of Lacuna a reality.

See you in the Space!
I'm sorry that I couldn't attend to the Lacuna Swing last Sunday, and also for next Sunday 26 gonna miss it cause I have to work. 
But I can help and contribute with energy from Monday to Saturday!
I just emailed Mark man with a van, and he said he could help transport Ramin's couch and another armchair donation to Lacuna for 60 EUR - it would take about an hour. I don't know if the Lacuna bank thinks this is a worthwhile use of Lacuna funds or not, but what do you think? I don't know how much in advance one has to reserve a Robben and Wientjes van; Mark could do this job next week. Might be nice to have the couch in the space in time for the internal activation party.
Even tho, shapewise it fits quite okay in the kitchen area at the moment the vote has decided that it should serve in another space.

Nobody I asked was sure who brought it in. Maybe this person can now again decide where to take it. If its not for use for you, we would help to put it into the wild.
Maybe it is better to keep temporary things if they can serve a purpose until something better replaces it? I'm fine with replacing the grey thing, but until you find a nice free wooden cabinet on the street, the one we have now is more helpful than leaving stacks of paper out in the open, oder? Unless people are already working on a kitchen cabinet replacement - is this happening?
Just wanted to make sure that everyone is aware, I am using the large room at Lacuna for a dance rehearsal tomorrow, Thursday the 30th from 10am-1pm.  It has been on the calendar for a long time, but I’m not sure if everyone checks there very regularly.  

I’m hoping that holding it in the morning/early afternoon will be easiest to not interfere with other people’s use of the space (things are usually pretty quiet in there on weekday mornings.)   We are working in the main large room, but of course the side rooms with doors on them are still free for people to come in and work.  If you plan to be there and working in the End room connected to the large one, I’d just ask that you try to be fairly quiet and respectful while we rehearse. 
Claudine I think when we leave, we might put it full with stuff until we are to lazy to remove it. but okay- maybe there will be enough force, if we find something better. 
So lets seek out . and when we find something it can be turned into a sticker collector in the stairway or something
I just bought a couple of these wooden boxes (like the ones in the kitchen that Claudine brought in) from Bauhaus.  They're not overly expensive, and very modular, and there are some drawer inserts you can buy as well (check out my newly organized area in the corner of the End Area to see what they look like in person).

Perhaps we could use some Lacuna funds to buy a few more of those to make up for the storage space we would lose by tossing the grey wardrobe?
Just a quick note reminding you of the 🎊Activation Party🎊 at Lacuna this Friday!

There's no real plan beyond music, drinks, food, and friends--bring any ideas you think would be fun!

We can plan to get started around 19:00, but I'm sure some of us will be hanging around the space before then.

On the topic of food: there's been talk of doing a potluck, so if you can, bring some food to share.  We could also arrange a mass pizza delivery or something similar--let me know your opinion and I can organize that.

We've got a pretty awesome space going here, and I'm excited to celebrate it with everyone who helped make it possible.
In my desk there's a number of a guy who would deliver drinks.
I don't know if he can do same-day delivery...

If someone calls him, it would be good to mention that we are 18 people
and plan to host weekly events, so he knows it's not just a one time thing.

If not we can just go to Netto or Getränke Hoffmann...
Well, I think we can say that was a roaring success. Food was super tasty, playlist was perfect, thanks, Soma, lots of lovely people hanging out, only beer spillages were done by our own members (you know who you are), one case of a member being attacked by an art piece, and we are still definitely, without a doubt a non-profit!

On thy last point, could the peeps who are out of pocket let us know what the damage is so we can transfer some money to you to share the cost of the drinks. Next time we can take turns running the bar. Make it more official-like.
I would maybe get those boxes without drawers (the drawers cost 30€).
As drawers we can find a nice metal box in the flea market.

Or wet get lucky and find something nice on the street or online.
Or build a nice artsy irregular wood closet thing with wood pieces.
I am going to show Lacuna to a Rama, she works for Autodesk and she oversees Brand Partnerships for Autodesk an new ways to creatively collaborate in a meaningful way that will be mutually beneficial. As part of that endeavor, I am conducting a listening tour in the UK and Germany to connect with some of the great innovators and organizations focused on design and the future.

Does anybody interested in joining the meeting? What about if we do a show and tell for her with sessions like the Show and tell of monday? Any ideas?
I'm interested, though would love to better understand what I'm signing up for my interest for:) Sounds like this could just serve as an informative meeting to share what we're capable of and that we wouldn't necessarily need to prepare any proposals, but depends on what kinds of partnerships and for what timeline she might be looking for (i.e. Project proposals, talent scouting to join existing projects and collaborations, hosting sponsored events or workshops, etc).
As i told during last weeks show and tell we are going to meet this
sunday, I've just added it to the trello calendar.

We are going to be working on trying to get ready the first release
candidate of the next OF release, 0.9. Will be mostly fixing bugs but
there's also some documentation and install guides for the new supported
platform (OF for the web) to write.

We'll be there from 10 in case anyone wants to join.
I've mentioned this to a few of you, but wanted to send an official email as well. I have an architect friend visiting tomorrow through the 16th, and would like to let him use my desk to focus on his thesis/a workshop we're planing for the next few days as I'm busy here at School of Ma preparing for this upcoming show. As I haven't been there to use my desk, I had arranged with Johanna who is visiting to borrow my desk space for her time at Lacuna, so that would mean the desk behind (previously Phoebe's). I know it has been up for grabs and used by a couple of people, but hoping it's cool to reserve back a space for just these few days. His name is Arnaud, and he works at WOMA, a Fab Lab in Paris (there have been talks of organizing an exchange program:).
Tomorrow is gonna be the hottest day of these days heat wave. School is over the weekend is close. let's refresh our heads in the cool of a nice and clean lake.

I propose two options. 
We've just noticed that tomorrow we have both the Cyborgs meeting and the weekly Show + Tell scheduled.

Rather than consider this a "conflict", I thought perhaps we could try combining the two meetings, so our two associations could get to know one another better: Lacunans could go around and show examples of what we do, and the Cyborgs could talk about what interests and motivates them.

And who knows--maybe we'll come up with some brilliant cyborg/creative coding hybrid project ideas!

Let us know what you think (Enno, in particular).  Is resistance futile?
We’re going to have a talk with discussion at 8pm as I already invited you. I couldn’t reschedule that because of a guest speaker but we surely can (and will traditionally) start later. I understand it this way: Show and Tell will be all over the space and the talk will be a part of it in the main area, where attends who likes to.

I hope, that’s fine for everyone?
I’m not at all amused that today again I must stick to my office due to some urgent and important TODOs. I don’t know if or when I’ll manage to show up this evening. Please stick for our cryonics talk to Stefan Greiner who will be there and moderate it.
If we do have someone for such short time, would it make sense to have a
slightly higher price, like 50€? because the paperwork and time to
organize things is the same for us, no matter if it's one week or one month.

But do we want to have people just for a week or two?

I have the impression that in such a short time there's no time for a
meaningful exchange between Lacuna and that person (maybe many members
would not even meet that person during the time), and sounds close to
the kind of service provided by a co-working space.

Mmm... except if they are known friends, in which case they are already
connected to Lacuna through our members, and a short visit can make
sense  When you first asked I imagined someone random asking for a
desk for one week...
Yeah, in this particular case I'm talking about Kurt Strong from School of MA last year. Personally, I've been looking for opportunities to work with him since last year but he lives in New Zealand usually so it's hard to get something rolling. Anyway, he has an option to come over for a week and hang out / work with us. He has lots of fun ideas, all-round nice guy, all that shit.

BTW the context I'm going by regarding "Shorter rent period[s]" is the July All Hands
I think Abe's idea of charging a little more to cover all the admin related to short term visits is a good idea. 
In general not opposed to visiting artists for a week or two but is nice if they have some connection to the space  or something to offer.

Perhaps we could ask that all short term people present something at show and tell so we can get to know them and their work?
Yeah I also agree not to turn it into a coworking space and that anyone visiting for a month should be a close friend / collaborator of a permanent member. Would also agree that up to a week rent free is fine. Should we try it out this time and see if it works for us? Anyone opposed / has an alternative suggestion?
as the adults are gone, is anyone up for celebrating our freedom in a good old home alone manner with video games and pizza and trapping the house and/or beers on the terrace or something, one of the next days?
I am leaving to brazil for a time (don't know how long) . It will be good to say goodbye to you all! it was a marvelous time together and lets keep in touch for future projects that might come.. :)

I left a cardboard box with materials, feel free to take them. 
Im also leaving the blue neons: make a logo with that! it will look amazing!

I am also selling my bike for 50 euros. image in annex. if someone is interested let me know. Its in Lacuna in the afternoon.

Also, If someone is interested to buy the LED Ball from taiwan for 50 euros, let me know!

Hope to see you around today!
Just dropping a quick email in search of the key to aBe's flat, which was dropped off at Lacuna earlier this week.

All we know is that "a colleague" received the key when it was dropped off at the space, and I'm going to need it when I get back to Berlin tomorrow afternoon--does anyone know what might have happened to it?

Thanks, and greetings from Mallorca!
Did you know that today marks the three-month anniversary of our move-in to the space? It's true--our collective is now officially 0.25 years old!

And that makes the time seem about ripe for another newsletter, so strap on your reading pants and let's get this thing going.
Arrivals / Departures

There's been a couple changes to the Lacuna lineup lately:

First, we bid adieu to Anaisa, who is returning her homeland of Brazil for the foreseeable future. Safe travels Anaisa!

Next, most you have probably already met Joana Moll, but she never got a proper email introduction, so: Welcome Joana! She's just joined our family for the month, and will be returning to Barcelona on 7 Sept, but we might have convinced her to come back later this year. So if you don't get to say Hi before she leaves, just pester her to return in October. :)

And last but not least, welcome Nenad "Nesa" Popov, who just joined us this week as a one-month trial member. Some of you may already know him from his work with the Science Hack Lab and Creative Coding Jam, and we have actually had an image of his work hanging in the kitchen for a while (the "How Can We All Make It To The Future?" poster). He's currently sharing the black table with Ramin in the main room, so drop by, say hi, and ask him about the cool stuff he's working on!
Alternating Mondays

Some people have raised the opinion that having a Show + Tell every Monday might be a bit too frequent, and proposed changing the structure a bit. So we're going to give that a try: we'll still meet every Monday, but alternate the purpose of the meeting each week between a Show + Tell and a Sub-Committee meeting.

The idea behind this new structure is that will it give us all a little more time between Show + Tells to amass something interesting to show, and it will also give a regular cadence to the Sub-Committee meetings, which should help us close out our administrative tasks a bit more efficiently and help get Lacuna to the next stage in its glorious evolution.

The calendar has been updated to reflect this, and we'll start with the Show + Tell tomorrow. Nenad, if you'are able to attend tomorrow, maybe you could prepare a little something to introduce yourself to the group?

And please, as always, if you have opinions one way or the other on this change, voice them on this Trello card!
External Ausstellung

Speaking of Lacuna's glorious evolution, we've been planning since our founding to have both an Internal and an External Activation, announcing our existence to the world. We had a pretty fantastically successful Internal Activation Party (which, incidentally, happened on our two-month anniversary, or Lacuna's 0.166...th birthday), but we still don't have any concrete plans for an External one, so let's start that conversation.

The dream was that we could have the External Activation take the form of a collective exhibition (or Ausstellung, for the German and German-wannabes among you), and we had initially thought that we could host such an Ausstellung at Lacuna itself. However, as things have moved along, and we have turned the space into our atelier and home, it seems less and less appropriate (and secure) to have such a public event there. Additionally we have friends at Spektrum and PLU41 who are excited to offer their spaces to us, both of which are much more conducive to an exhibition.

Spektrum, as most of you probably already know, is geared toward art/technology projects and presentations, with events running only a single night. PLU41 is another space also focusing on the intersection of art and technology, but their format is closer to a traditional art gallery's, with exhibitions running for a couple weeks or more.  Thomas has been in contact with them, and they are curious about our collective and interested in exhibition proposals.

So, all that to say, we have two great places in the neighbourhood where we can exhibit; the next question is, what do we show? Maybe you have some project ideas you've been waiting for an excuse to start?

Let's start the conversation about what and how we'd like to present Lacuna to the world through our first exhibition here, which will be a one-night event at Spektrum. After the ideas are a bit more solidified, we can talk to Spektrum about our proposal and set a concrete deadline.

And after that's a success, we can talk about putting up something longer-term at PLU41!
Lacuna on Vimeo + Tumblr

Lacuna Lab also now has Tumblr and Vimeo accounts, where we can show off experiments and works-in-progress from our space. The Tumblr is already getting a surprising amount of attention for being so young (turns out Tumblr is a good platform for exposure).

Let us know if you have something you've been working on that you'd like to share!
Happy Birthday to Sarah

Since it is now after midnight, it is officially her birthday and no longer bad luck in Germany to do so: let's wish Sarah a Happy Birthday!

Thanks for inviting us to your garden party tonight, Sarah! I've uploaded a few pictures to OwnCloud--let me know if you have any trouble viewing them.

Also, let aBe know if you would like access to OwnCloud and don't have it yet. I think it can be a great place for us to collect all the photos we take of our activities in and around Lacuna.
Last Words

I think that's all the news for now, which is probably enough--I know these emails will be long when I start them, and they still end up even longer than I expect. If you've made it this far, thanks for sticking with me, and you can claim your complimentary cookie by telling me the secret words "verbose Vorsitzender" next time you see me in person.*

As always, I want to thank you all for helping making Lacuna the community it has become--it's all about having the right people, and we certainly have them. Four months ago, this place was a dark and dingy cave, and now it's a flourishing garden of art, ideas, and interactions (and tomatoes). I look forward to where our journey takes us next.

Hope you all enjoy the remaining days of summer, and I'll see you around the space!
I got to know masahiro at ramin's birthday party. He is the inventor of a brainwave interface, which allows you to use your brainwave to manipulate whatever you can imagine. I am keen on seeing his interface in action and am wondering if any of you are interested as well? 

He will be back to new york on 11th September, so maybe we can use next Monday evening (i know there is no show-and-tell) to have him over for a short demo? Drop me a line if you are interested, so that I can make sure the date works for everybody (or just me) :)
As most of you know I'm leaving next monday, back to this touristic apocalyptic paradigm called Barcelona ;) (there's still good food and the beer is not that bad... so come visit!)

I'd really like to have a goodbye party at Lacuna this saturday if everybody is ok with it, would love to see all of you there! BTW, Lacuna girls have 16€ free beers budget as a reward for our exhausting trip to the bottle cemetery last week ;)

So, what do you say?
Sure, please forward it to cyborgs! It's just that Masahiro decided to do the demo on creative stammtisch at co-up this Friday, would that work for cyborgs too?

ps. 2 people from lacuna just told me that they are interested but can't make it on Friday. And others worried that at stammtisch the demo can't be as in-depth. If it's the same for you, please let me know. So that there is a bigger chance for me to convince him to do another demo at Lacuna again :) (no guarantee tho)
we’re thinking about canceling our Cyborg meeting on Friday because of a conference/party at Netzpolitik.org and urge to discuss some things with people who will be there only.

So Monday would be cool. co-up is Adalbert-Str. 8 in Kreuzberg? And when do you plan to start on Monday?

I’d like to get in touch with Masahiro myself and would invite him to Lacuna when he’s in Berlin again.
So we're running with trying subcommittee check ins every second Monday (alternating with ShNT). It looks like the main committees in need of attention are admin&finance and design&identity. Shall we go for 19:30 -20:20 A&F and 20:30 - 21:20 D&A for today's check ins? Some of us are on both SCs so it's not possible to run them simultaneously. The format of the check ins can be mostly status updates and deciding on next actions to keep it brief.
Here's what was forwarded to a select group of us. I don't know why this particular selection was used. I'm with you on any information of this nature being readily available to anyone who wants it. I'm all for running things in any easy-going way but at the same time don't want to feel out of the loop. I actually thought aBe sent it to the entire mailing list until you mentioned it. Specifically on this point I'm moving for an Admissions subcommittee (please chime in here with your thoughts).

Do you have any objections to any of the things being said regarding Jerry joining for his 1 month trial? I was about to email him back with something like.
There are several organisational thing at the beginning indeed.

Basically next to signing a contract and adding you to the google group for group mail exchange, a hackpad, where we put some organisational and fun stuff and later a trello board.

the first month actually, I don't know if we mentioned that earlier is something like a trial period, to see if you like the atmosphere, can work here and try each other out.  You would get the after that time, when you become a permanent member. 
Regarding the place. It is a little chaotic, its okay, but some things need a rethinking. We also thought about a space in the room where thomas works- we call it the porner room- story later. simply because everything else is kindof set at the moment, before we make changes, which come at some point soon hope- especially regarding the room before that. 
I'm not sure tho, I think Aurelia was always sitting on the window place- not sure if she claims it or doesn't mind also regarding the furniture. She is still in San Francisco and will come back october I think.
You are also free to sit in the main room at the big table thats also cool. its like a free space.
It's simply that we need to trust someone before we give them keys to keep. However, during the day there is normally someone who can open the door, we have a phone that u can call to be sure. Sometimes  there also people staying late,  sometimes very late into the night.  In special cases you can ask someone to borrow u his/her keys. 
We need another general meeting for some important items. In particular, Lacuna is not insured, because the insurance company needs us to be a fully registered e.V., which we are not. To be a fully registered e.V. we need to amend our constitution/Satzung. To do the amendments we need to hold a general meeting. Phew!
Quick q. I'm in Paris working to make connections with WoMa and WOA, and there's interest in discussing opportunities for future collaborations with Lacuna. In the short-term, we're troubleshooting a couple of programs this week (today a 2-player game via raspeberry pi, and a simple LED thermometer later in the week). If anyone's free to lend some help on the code-advice side (possibly via skype), please send me a note:)
Unfortunately there still is no english translation. The new Satzung can be passed by a member meeting, but there should be a discussion if the members agree with Satzung, Finanzordnung und Laborordnung. I put the TODOs in Trello some time ago and have no overview if this had been discussed by now.
That shouldn't happen at all. Maybe they tried to use the "Telekom_FON" instead of "berlin.freifunk.net".

Also sorry for not checking and maintaining things I installed, when I'm not at Lacuna. I haven't been to Lacuna for like a month and if people give me a heads up when stuff is not working, I'm happy to fix it if my schedule permits.

If someone want's to have the password for the freifunk router or if we have a document for such information, no problem.
tonight a friend of mine and me will play a new audio-visual piece, it would be cool to see you there!
And if you are interested in any of the techniques used we can talk about them endlessly at Lacuna and maybe cook up something new together.
So: someone plugged the LAN Cable on the Freifunk Router into one of the yellow ports. Thats bad, because the traffic isn't routed through freifunk then but directly through our DSL Line. The cable needs to be in the blue socket.

It's fixed now. I unplugged the timer because: Timers draw 1-2 Watts all the time and the whole router draws approximately 2-3 Watts. So it doesn't really make sense financially. Also I believe freifunk is what should be used by everyone of our guests (simply for not having to do the whole "whats the password?" thing) and I'd would be kinda strange if it is switched of at 19:00. For example the Cybrog meetings happen after that. Also we share 10 MBit down and 2 MBit up maximum so there is enough bandwidth left even if neighbours use it as their primary internet access.
Just a quick reminder that the fortnightly subcommittees check in is tomorrow. Things on the list include finally translating our Satzung to English and getting updates about decisions regarding our VAT status. If you're on any of the committees see you tomorrow at 19:30. Starting with admin & finance like last time and probably more work on our website. We need designers for this BTW, otherwise we'll end up with a developer-looking site.
I won't be able to make the meeting tomorrow as I'm still out of town, but please keep me in the loop re: the website and how I can help. We have a good amount of progress on the design front : wires, logo, and a mockup V1. I'm happy to incorporate into an update and work with developers to integrate when I return (October 5), or before if I have time.
Thomas, do you by chance have access to the AI wireframe I had created on your computer a while back? Perhaps you could add along with your own mockups so our work so far could be integrated. If there starts to be a list of requested updates or specs, feel free to send my way - I'm happy to help update to a v2 wire/mockup if it's helpful.
Thanks for sharing, I agree with your comments. To be clear, the latest live link hans't been updated with my own or Thomas's thoughts (I believe Thomas has access to these files) from our previous wires/mockup as part of the Design subcommittee. I'm not able to contribute to the code, but am happy to discuss how I can be of help to evolve the wires I've already created with any updates after tomorrow's meeting/or with thoughts from Claudine and others who are working on the development side. Unfortunately, my computer was broken at the time so the design files are living on Thomas's computer, but he may have uploaded them to Trello or shared elsewhere. 
Yes, more live tomorrow, but regarding the vimeo thumbnails, I tried using vimeo's hubnut, which would have embedded videos, but that did not work for some reason. The other option is manually embedding video which I thought was too manual; the current thing automatically shows thumbnails of the latest 6 things on vimeo. I agree with you that it is best not to have to go to another website. In my ideal world, there would be an automatic feed of links which when clicked would react like when you click on photos in facebook. It would come to the fore, but you can also close it and return to the main page.

btw, the page you are viewing now is just one of several iterations - if you haven't already, maybe you should take a look at the iterations of versions to get a sense of everyone's aesthetic.

and as Seamus said, it's good to have the members page go to the hackpad so that he gets irritated enough to change it. If you don't like something, change it.
Please can we set up an all members meeting in order to get our train on track.

We like to get our Vereinsregistereintrag, steps might be:

Send an invitation to all members for Mitgliederhauptversammlung two weeks in advance.

Make and vote on changes of our Satzung.

This will include finding and electing a board to fullfill the requirements sent to us by Amtsgericht Charlottenburg.

On the same meeting we can decide about our VAT status and than set up a meeting with our tax consultant, recommended by Thomas and also show him the changes of the Satzung and ask if everything is fine. Our decision on the Vat status does not consider the Satzung.

Than we can forward it to our notary and led our Satzung be sent to Charlottenburg.
Of course, but problem is the files live on Thomas' computer - maybe you can ask him if he's around? I'm co-leading a workshop this week, but I will try to find time to search through to see if I can find a copy online somewhere if he's offline. If he's there, will be fastest to ask him.
In light of another break in occurring in an office the area (many MacBooks stolen), it's a bit worrying to find an unlocked window in Lacuna this morning...

Generally regarding security, does anyone have experience with alarm monitoring companies? We have a control panel and sensors so it should simply be a case of hiring a company to monitor everything.
Awesome, thanks Thomas. Btw, before we get the official versions, you can view the photoshop files with Gimp, and you can change the extension of the .ai file to .pdf and view it (since it was saved with pdf compatibility). just if you are impatient like me.
We had our subcommittee evening. Present were Thomas, Séamus, aBe, Claudine, Nayeli (briefly). We only did design & identity this time. We discussed the logo, website and social media. We worked on the about text for the site and on an animation of Claudine's.
Thanks for checking back about this:) I am still looking! Are you by chance interested? If not, could you help to collect an answer whether anyone at Lacuna is interested/available (deadline sometime to be agreed upon in October)? I'd like to give them a clear yes or no Tuesday or Wednesday this week so they can make plans accordingly.

It could be exciting for Lacuna-the first of what could be an ongoing series of projects between this fab lab/architecture studio in Paris (WoMa, WOA) doing fabrication, Lacuna the code, and both the concept co-design. 

It would be project collaboration rather than help-this first round involves coding a program for LEDs to light up based on one of three received images (I'm on the UX either way, but they're very interested to work with Lacuna on the realization if we are).
Thanks for the networking you are doing! Can you provide more context? I'm curious how you are in touch with these groups (they have gorgeous things on their website) - did you already have contacts there, or have you been working with them already, or... I'm also wondering what is the motivation for the projects you mentioned - the 2 person Raspberry game, and the LED thermometer? Dunno, maybe it would be more efficient to have a skype/google hangout chat today if you have time, especially if you need a decision so soon.
Sorry, I can't say anything new now and probably won't be able to do so for at least another one or two months. It's going to take a while until I really know, since I need to do further work on my portfolio, find job opportunities, need to apply for jobs, need to apply for a visa. Meanwhile I need to do other work too of course.

Realistically I think I'm not going to make it before the beginning of February (earliest)​. But that's just a guess …
How long in advance do you really need to know, when I'm exactly going to leave? Of course I will tell you as soon as I know!
It would be great if we could handle this rather open and without big promises on both sides. I'm sure we'll find a solution if there is a problem with overlapping of another person who wants to take my place.

And assuming the trial month goes well, I would of course like to come back after this trip (6-12 months).
The nature of a Satzung is in general not scary.
It is more an instrument to communicate the goals and purpose of an association. It explains why it is there and defines how it works.
It reflects the values of Lacuna Lab e.V and its members.
Today as we were leaving the robot exhibition in Spektrum, Alfredo suggested that the Lab do an exhibition. They are booked up through March 2016, and they do just one exhibition per month. So, the earliest we could book Spektrum would be April 2016. What say you? Talk amongst yourselves.
Thanks Alfredo for mentioned the idea of Lacuna Lab having our own exhibition - we've been talking about this as well, and we'd love to sign up for April 2016. Marcel, who is cc'ed, will be your contact regarding this.
The goal of the lab is to develop live audio-visual performances, to learn how to play with each other and to develop relevant technology(if it doesn't exist yet:)
The group is a nice mix of first timers and experienced collaborators, so it's a great place to get you started into live performances if you didn't dare to do it yet!
When the group feels like presenting stuff to the public, we will organize events. 

Tomorrow will be first hands on session, to be honest I expect it to be a bit chaotic because of all different cables/plugs people are using/missing - but it should settle down eventually.


If you are into performing live audio, visuals or audiovisuals it would be great to see you there!

If you think about joining, please email me with with kind of output you're using(hdmi/vga/computer output - small jack, xlr, ethernet whatever) so we can make sure we got you covered.
Just dropping a quick line to those of you who are on the edge of your seat wondering "when is Soma back in Europe?"  I was originally scheduled to leave today, but my trip has been extended by a bit, and I'm now planning to return to Berlin on 8 October, just in time for the All-hands Meeting. :)

I'm excited by the conversations about our first exhibition with Spektrum--can't wait to talk more about it in person!
Some of you have already heard I´m gonna get married this very Friday. I would like you to join us.

Here's our plan: At 11:30 in the morning we'll get married at Standesamt Neukölln in Blaschkoallee 32. If you want to come along to see the show better arrive some minutes earlier. The party will take place in Platzhaus Helmholzplatz on said Helmholzplatz in the barrio of Prenzlauer Berg. If you find the plaza you can't miss the house.  We'll be there from 5 p.m. on, doing some preparations. If you wanna give us a helping hand come along, there will be drinks already. ¡Real Starting Point will be around 7 p.m.!

To provide you and us with all the good stuff we need some help though. We're talking DRINKS and FOOD. Of course we will have drinks and some dishes there already but we'd highly appreciate your support in turning this night into a rather decadent one. So bring whatever comes to your mind.

Also feel free to bring some music (mp3) you want to shake them legs to to feed our playlist. That'd be great.
there was accidentally a FB page created which we cannot edit. I just made a new offical one. Everyone who wants to have admin access please let me know. Don't forget to change your profil info to address the new page if you are connected to the old (unoffical) one.
Some things for starting in Lacuna. I just invited you to our "Us" hackpad. That's our internal page for letting each other know about what we do and what collaborations we're looking for.

Let me know also if you can access our google calendar. This is where we write in our events and when we'll be away.

We'll get you on our internal mailing list (google group) soon too.
Just for anyone who didn't already know, Jerry (Jeremias Volker) started his one month of "let's try each other out" in Lacuna yesterday. If you haven't already read about him, here it is:

I’m working as freelancing Interaction and Computational designer since 1,5 years after finishing my studies in Interface Design at FH Potsdam.
Almost everything I do is simply spoken at the intersection of technology, code and design. There are two main field, that I currently like to work in. One is to create interactive installations for exhibitions, fairs, festivals and so on. Especially when working for exhibitions I like to be challenged by new topics in every project. Another is stage related work, which is mostly visuals or other show elements. Here I like the little thrill you get, while working in performances, never exactly knowing what happens. Technically seen, I worked a lot with Kinect and looked closer into Shaders as well as node based programming frameworks lately. And since I just started freelancing, I’m still quite open for many things.
The unfinished portfolio I share with my brother can be found here: soon.bloodbrothers.io
I was involved in almost everything which is not plain classic graphic design.

What do I expect from such a place?
I would like to find a warm, bright, welcoming and creative space, with friendly mix of people. Some of them should be working in the fields of design, art, code and electronics for direct exchange of knowledge. It would be nice to have more people there working in related fields like photography/film, product design, handicrafts, music and others. And ideally there would be space to built up and test installations and maybe a place to do some more dirty handicraft work.
I left the windows open, cuz it was hot- but forgot to remind you. 
You have to close the windows when you are the last to leave or when there are people in other rooms, close the windows in the rooms you were using.
Julie, a friend of mine, wants to shoot a video interview with me for self-publishing and job application. We would like to do that Tuesday, Oct 21 at 8pm in the Lab. Preliminarily I put that in the Lab calendar - the date was free. The shooting will last 60-90 minutes, no team, just Julie and me and the request for having the place quiet.
please don't forget to attend the meeting on Friday. It is a very important one! There are several things on the agenda that we have to talk about and decide on (e.g. changes to the Satzung).

I also called Taekker today. The Hausmeister is coming tomorrow between 11 am and 2 pm to fix the heating. Someone has to be there. Who can do this?
I've been updating our logo on our channels such as Vimeo and Twitter to our newly finalised one (thanks to Thomas) but I need log in details for Tumblr (they're not in Trello). I know Thomas also needs them for styling the Tumblr page. Who set that account up? I also switched the Vimeo account to use our gmail address for logging in so use that one.
I'm leaving my bike at lacuna until I'm coming back. Feel free to use it if u need :) the code for the locker is 2001. (I'm attaching a pic of the bike).

It's been great days, I was really happy to spend some time with all of u again, its quite sad to leave, but ill be back pretty soon and for longer time probably! 
Yes!  Very interested to get the conversation going on this.

Maybe people could chime in on the Trello card about any ideas for themes/projects/anything else relating to the exhibition, and that will give us some starting points.
My band Arlequino (experimental grooving hard rock) is going to release our first EP as soon as possible. I'm looking for some advice on how to reach potential listeners.

The EP itself will be released on Bandcamp and on a collector's USB card (see below). Our main promotion will be a short promotional video that we will share on facebook and other channels. This plays a short montage of the music over an animation with overlaid text directing the viewer to the website/Bandcamp (I'm making the animation with openFrameworks with post-processing probably done in Blender). The website will be simple with a p5.js element matching the animation in the video and a link to the Bandcamp page. 

So if anyone has any experience with promotion / reaching a target audience I'd love to hear some pointers.
we are currently making attempts to have a decent bookkeeping system for Lacuna. In this process, we are sending out invoices for the months that have already past. You should have paid these and, therefore, do not have to worry about them.
I'm planning to go bouldering tomorrow (Friday) around 6pm at www.boulderklub.de which is just around the corner of Lacuna!
You are very welcome to join me and probably a few others!

We do bouldering and sometimes rope climbing as well on kind of a regular basis. Usually every week and whenever somebody likes to go, which is usually Monday to Friday in the evening.
If anybody is interested in getting on the mailing list, just let me know!
I met Gene Kogan at the Sonic Code Session at Spektrum last week, and he
also came to the Stammtisch to share his work. Tomorrow is his last day
in Berlin before he flies back to NY.

I asked him to help us set up the tools so we can play with... "Style
transfer, a technique of recomposing images in the style of other
images... created using Justin Johnson's code based on the paper by
Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge demonstrating a method for restyling images
using convolutional neural networks."
Just a few bits and bobs for you...

FreeCAD Workshop
Those of you who were at the Show + Tell at the end of October may remember Michael Ang (a.k.a. Mang) talking about his Light Catchers project.

He has offered to teach a free workshop at Lacuna on getting started with FreeCAD, an open-source parametric 3D modeling software suite, which he used extensively in the making of his project.

We're thinking the first week of December.  Who all would be interested in attending?

The Joys of Steuer
Today aBe, Thomas, and I visited a Steuerberater specializing in e.V.'s to talk about how best to formulate our Satzung for Gemeinnützigkeit (charitable) status.  We also discussed different options for formulating the rates and/or membership fees at Lacuna Lab, and their tax implications for both the e.V. and its members.

It's all painfully exciting stuff, so I won't go into the gory details here, but we'll be sharing our findings soon in the form of an invitation to one final Satzung-changes meeting (I promise it will be more fun than the last one), so stay tuned!

School of Ma Interview
I recently did an interview with Rachel for the School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe about being an alumnus of her program and how it led to the founding of Lacuna Lab.  Check it out on the School of Ma blog!

That's all for now.  Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow at 7pm to chat about our first public exhibition!  And if we don't see you there, then maybe at Rin & Wischi's going-away drinks on Thursday, or at Mei-Fang's presentation at Scope Sessions, or at the Swing on Sunday!  (Wow, busy week.)
Thank you very much for your trust and making me a full member of the Lacuna. I'm really happy to be here and enjoy the space and you guys a lot (even if I look quite serious sometimes)!

Since yesterday I'm also proud owner of a Lacuna Lab key. But it looks like we ran out of keys for the building/gate. So next week I'm going to have more copies made.
Who else needs a key?

Please let me know by Sunday evening! Thanks.
Welcome Jerry!  Good to have you on-board!

And as you may have already found out, making copies of the Hof key requires written consent from Tækker, our landlord company.

In the past, Marcel got the necessary documentation for this, so maybe you can get the contact info from him.  It should be as simple as writing a letter and getting a response in the mail.
Wait, two wordy email blasts from Soma in one week?  He must really have something exciting to say...


External Activation Exhibition

As most of you are already aware, we had a great meeting last night to discuss our first public exhibition as a collective.

We brainstormed about potential project ideas, event formats, methods to facilitate collaboration, and, perhaps most excitingly, nailed down specific dates for the event!

Lacuna Lab's first public showing will be 22-24 April, at Spektrum!

We will also have 21 April available for setup and 25 April for teardown.

For those of you who couldn't make the meeting last night (or who did make the meeting, but need a refresher on what we said), check out this Hackpad.

As you'll (hopefully) see from the notes, in order to make the project ideas and theme of the exhibition more concrete, we tried to come at the discussion from two different angles: First, we went around and shared ideas we've been wanting to work on, to start conversations about potential collaborations.  Then, we approached from a higher-level, talking about possible overarching themes for the show that could guide our thinking as we formulate proposals.

Of course, both of these processes will be ongoing...


Creating Fertile Ground for Collaboration

Since part of the ethos of Lacuna Lab is to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration, we figured it would be helpful to figure out some channels and methods for doing so more effectively.

When I was at the School of Ma, we did one exercise that I found worked particularly well for seeding the exchange of ideas:

    Each member filled out a "Project Stack" on Hackpad, a list of ideas they'd had, no matter how vague or undeveloped.
    Other members could read and comment on the ideas, to help develop the ideas and possibly suggest collaboration ideas. 
    Finally, we all got together to chat and present our ideas, so group discussion could develop the ideas even further, hopefully into a concrete final project plan.

At last night's meeting there was agreement to try this approach, so to that end, I've put together a Project Stacks Hackpad where we can get the conversation started.

We also decided to re-purpose the Show + Tell on 7 Dec as an Idea Exchange, where we can do that last step of chatting in person about the ideas we've been developing.  (That means, please try to fill in some of your ideas before then!)

It's a good idea to keep a list of project ideas anyway, that we can consult periodically when the motivation (and time) for collaboration strikes us.  Lacunan A says to Lacunan B: "So I've been thinking about that project you posted a while ago, and I thought it would be cool if we did this..."

After all, that kind of conversation is what Lacuna is all about!


So that's all the news for now, but I'd say that's plenty for one week. ;)
It turns out there's no safe way to use Arturo's pole with the mount I have, so we'll need to buy one more piece before the project is finished, but progress has been made!

For tonight's SC Check-In, I wanted to propose that we use the time to make some forward movement on the website.  Namely, we should identify the underlying infrastructure, like what CMS to use, where we will host, etc... Hopefully such decisions can be made quickly and we can get to the exciting part of actually getting the designs coded and the content online.
My understanding was that the insurance contract was blocked by our e.V. not being fully founded and in the Vereinsregister. Wasn't this the word we got from the first insurance company we were communicating with?

Unless this new company is willing to give us a contract without our being in the Register, I think our situation won't change until we finish our Satzung discussions with Herr Pörksen...
No objection from my side, and I'd be happy to take care of us.

Only thing is that I still don't have the gate/building key(it's in the process as far as I know), so if I don't get it maybe someone can borrow me his for a day?
Hi Ramin!   I have the main room in Lacuna booked for next Wednesday the 25th for a dance performance, is it not showing up on the calendar for you?    Unless you mean the Wed after that (the 2nd) in which case that would be awesome to host them and I’d be happy to help out with it too. 

We'll have a few special guests at the Show + Tell on Monday: Rachel and her students at the School of Machines, Making and Make-Believe would like to come and share their project proposals for their final show at Spektrum on Saturday.

The theme of this month's School of Ma session is Facts and Fictions in the Age of Data: Art, Technology, and Data Visualization, so I'm sure the ideas will have some significant overlap with our interests at Lacuna.

Come meet the students and give your "professional" feedback! :)

FreeCAD Workshop

As mentioned in an earlier email, Mang has offered to teach a free workshop on 8 or 9 December at Lacuna on getting started with FreeCAD, with an emphasis on using his Polygon Construction Kit plugin to generate custom 3-D joints for sculptures like these:
Inline image 2Inline image 1

I haven't heard a lot of feedback from Lacunans who are interested (if you are, please speak up!), but I personally am pretty stoked about it and would love to host the talk at Lacuna.

To that end, I was thinking about opening it up on meetup.com, following the same space-limited format as we did with the Artgames meetup.

I wanted to check first here to see if there were any more Lacunans who wanted to attend (which would in turn limit how many public seats we would leave open), and whether there were any objections to the idea.

If I don't hear anything by mid-next week, I'll create the meetup.com invite and share it here.

That's all for now--time to go make some stuff with aBe and Mei and all the other attendees at today's Creative Code Jam.
Filipe Pirlo, a friend of mine asked me to have an excursion to Lacuna Lab with the students of his postgraduate seminar. The date would be Monday, November, 30th. He expects to have 10 participants. It is a mix of artists and philosophers. Till Wittwer will be giving a workshop about the Deep Web. Any Lacunian is warmly invited to join.

The seminar is about creative research on plant consciousness. Filipe was already in Lacuna in the very beginning—he and his group of thinkers were part of our first event ever in Lacuna (organized by Cyborgs).  

There is nothing planned so far according to the calendar. Is everyone alright with taking this opportunity to connect and having this workshop here?   
sorry for not answering right away after your meeting last week.

From looking at the Hackpad it seems like there is only one question about the Betriebshaftpflicht from Allianz:
"Are we required to be in the Vereinsregister before getting our contract?" I'll ask them about this now!

For the Inhaltsversicherung it seems like AXA is going to be a lot cheaper, if you plainly adjust the coverages. And if we ask for a new offer with lower coverage, I don't think that's going to change either.
So I think the question is, when can we expect to be a proper Verein and get the insurance? Should we wait or try to have something else (and maybe more expensive) like Allianz in the meantime?
I’d like to invite you all on Wednesday evening for a dance performance I’ll be involved in, happening at Lacuna Lab!  It’s an improvisation performance between a dancer, and poet, and myself.  It’s an ongoing/durational performance across 2 hours, so the audience is free to arrive any time during the performance, and leave as they will.   

Tomorrow (Tuesday) evening we will be doing a rehearsal in the main room between 7-10pm, so we will be moving the tables out of the way and using the projector.  The rest of Lacuna will be free for working in (so long as the main room is kept pretty dark, and fairly quiet.)  On Wednesday the performance will start at 8pm and last until 10. 

If you can’t make Wednesday but would still be interested in seeing the performance, we will also be performing on Thursday from 8-10pm at Kulturraum Mainz 7.  
Does anybody know if there is an original key I'm going to need to do this, or can I just take any of the copies we have? Do they even need a key to reproduce copies?
Can we maybe get a proper secure cylinder for that door before making more and more copies of the current insecure one? Insecure as anyone can learn how to open it in a minute or less by practicing for an hour. Without destroying it!

Last time I researched lock cylinders for anotjer space we choose the BKS Janus because it's resonably priced (for what it is), more keys are not too expensive and becuase it is really secure. It can only be opened by experts with a lot of time and special tools.
Unfortunately I won't be able to swing in to the Lab today, but our friend aBe was hoping to make some headway on painting the floor a brighter, more inviting colour. Hopefully some of us can get in to help!
we(well mostly Abe) painted the floor of the small room today, and it already looks way more fresh!

The paint needs about 24h to dry, so I guess it would be good to keep out of it until tomorrow afternoon.
Maybe it will need one more pass, but it's up to the people using the room!

Meanwhile you can use the common room, including my table(just be gentle to the stuff on it) since I won't be there until Tuesday morning.
How do people feel about Monday (before the Idea Exchange) or Tuesday evening next week to go over the current state of the website?

And I am still having wifi issues from time to time.  I think it's worth trying that ultra-long Ethernet cable that's already threaded through most of the space and just attaching another access point in the end room.

Also, unrelated and maybe deserving of another email, but...  Mang has decided to postpone the FreeCAD workshop until schedules calm down a bit after the New Year.
Announced this already in an unrelated email, but just so the context is right and people who care notice it:

Mang is busy the rest of December and has decided to postpone the FreeCAD workshop until after the New Year, so we'll revisit scheduling it in January.
Deep Web Workshop would be from 10 am to 2 pm. There still time for a meeting after this and before the ideas talk. I just wrote Filipe and asked him if he already found a new workshop leader. As soon as I have news I'll let you know.
I don't think that the smell is a big problem. The bigger issue is that there is nothing in the room when the workshop is going to start which means it has to be prepared from 9 am on. And I don't know how resistant the paint is after 24 hours (realistically it will only be 18 to 20 hours).

If it is possible to paint it tonight and make the second layer tomorrow evening I think everything is working fine. Otherwise, it is a bit risky. I am currently with my daughter and can't come around, but I could help with the second layer tomorrow evening.  
Hey Lacunians,

there is a Trello card regarding our final party for this year in Lacuna. I also created a Doodle two days ago asking for the best date for everyone to celebrate together. It seems like the link was not sent by Doodle :(

Let's start the conversation now! Check the Trello card for the first thoughts already made and use the Doodle to have a party before the year is over.
so we would need to buy that lock cylinders and would we need to pay someone to put it in. 
It's a little late for stopping to complete that basically every permanent member and coming in the future would have a key
to the lab for oneself.
if the total cost are considerable okay I would be okay with that. since we could new keys for all of use with one go and not have any hassle with coordinating :).
we could also the melt the old ones and make a sculpture out of them.

I don't know what of my things would be covered by the insurance if I just have them standing around there. instruments or any old stuff or whatever I probably don't have a bill for. 

so we could make an assumption how much in total get an idea how that is relative to our finances and make a vote on that?
Yes, We need to pay the cylinder plus keys. putting it in can be done by anyone that can use a screwdriver (it's just one screw). And I would just get like 20 or 30 keys because I guess the space will never have more than 30 members?! Getting keys with the cylinder is cheaper than having them made later, most of the time, also those keys can only remade by the factory if you send the physical "keycard" in, I guess thats a good thing but you need to have some extra keys because you can't just copy them everywhere.
I am with aBe here. Changing the cylinder doesn't seem very convincing to me. If at all, I suggest buying a Querriegel- or Panzerschloss. This would help against people that are simply breaking the door from outside with a crowbar. The cylinder is too short to prevent from that. And I also think it has to be installed by a professional.  
I googled a little trying to find out if we are allowed to change the lock by ourself without losing insurance protection. I couldn't really find an answer. It seems to be possible but might depend on the individual insurance company and contract.
is anyone planning to attend the Deep Web Workshop? I am currently in the situation where I have to find someone to open the door for the participants. I have to teach at the school and can only be in Lacuna from around 11.30, 12 on. The person I asked to take over my lesson just canceled its assurance. I still try to find someone to give him/her my lesson so that I can be in Lacuna myself. In case I fail, is anyone willing to take over that task for me (maybe someone who will be there anyway)?
Yes, I love this idea!  It's a collaboration that every one of us can take part in, creating the "voice" of Lacuna. :)

Let's chat more about it tonight at the Idea Exchange!
Nice idea.  I can definitely contribute some text at some point.

Sorry I will miss the meeting tonight about the exhibition.  I am totally keen to be involved in 1 or more projects and don't have any fixed ideas myself so keen to work with others on their ideas.
Hey, maybe of interest to someone?

The Museum of Tomorrow in Rio has a fellowship program for someone at the intersection of art, science, and technology. Though it says applications due yesterday, they've extended the deadline to Dec 20. Looks like they pay for your transport to Rio, and you get reimbursed for room and board and transport in Rio, but that's it.
I'm leaving tomorrow for Madeira residency and I'll be away for two weeks.
Since slime moulds started growing they'll need a bit of a care while I'm away.

So please help me out by giving them a few drops of water every day!

You're all busy people, so after talking to a few of you I decided to make this doodle where we can check who can take care of the creatures on which day. Link to the instructions page is also in there:

http://doodle.com/poll/9e3smqyxg47f2ybe

The air in lacuna is so dry that I'm afraid we can't miss a day:(

Drinks on me when I come back!

If you have any questions please email me.

Thanks and see you in two weeks!
Have a great Christmas and enjoy the Lacuna party.  I am flying to New Zealand tomorrow - back 2nd February - so I will be celebrating with you in spirit, unfortunately not in person.

Was a great year with you all and can't wait to be back and see what 2016 brings for Lacuna.
See you next year
Projection is gonna happen at lacuna new year. But I guess the big one
is enough for that.
Regarding the shelf. Do you know already where it could stand?
the furniture situation got already quite delicate.
there was a lot of work done on the website by the developers in the past weeks. The upcoming meeting could be used to talk together about the level reached. We could make some changes here and there, to get closer to the point where we can say the first iteration is finished for now.

Let's try to go online by the end of the month. :) What do think?

(This message especially addresses Ramin, Marcel, aBe and Aurelia and of course Soma, who could maybe join on Skype.)
Firstly, I'd like to point out that I'm turning this in before the official deadline :) I'm attaching a PDF as well as text below in case you have any trouble. No need for encrypting as it's a combination of public text: my thesis and a recent submission proposal. Only thing - there is a section on the second to last page with a list of references (feels free to remove if you think it may be problematic).
first of all thanks to everyone who participated at the meeting yesterday. It was really a big step forward and great fun!

Aurelia and I went out for a beer afterwards and both agreed on the fact that it was the best and most productive SC Design & Identity meeting so far.

Secondly, I wanted to kindly ask everybody to complete the list of native languages (spoken) in Lacuna. I need this for the texts I want to send to Marcel
We are planning a temporary exchange in the Porner room.

For the next 4 – 5 months Aurelia is going to work on two larger projects from Berlin and Paris and is not going to be at Lacuna meanwhile. 
At the same time, I'm going to collaborate with my friend Derk on a larger VR project (involving Unity and the Oculus Rift) until summer. We need a space to be able to work together almost full time.
Derk would now like to sublet Aurealia's desk for the next couple of months, so we could work together from here. It would be a great solution to all of us!
I think so far nobody else from Lacuna knows Derk really, but he is definitely is a super cool and friendly guy. I can totally vouch for him!

Everybody of the room is already cool with it. But we also wanted to ask you for any objections?

We would actually like to move Derk's stuff in here on Monday already. So in case you have any thoughts or questions about this, please answer until Sunday, 17th of January, 12:00 noon. We hope that's not too spontaneous.
Just wanted to add him to the Trello board and found out that he is already added there since November. The other potential members on the waiting list are currently on hold as far as I know.

I also think, it would be nice to integrate people into Lacuna as much as possible. Though, finishing a project with the help of a temporary residential buddy should maybe be possible without the deep background check that is meant for permanent members. Maybe the targeted timespan for the residency is a factor that could define the rules for the procedure?  
Just wanted to add I still plan to be a Lacuna member and contribute! For me at least, it's more a matter of time at my personal desk over the next few months, and subletting the desk space seems mutually beneficial as I'll be mostly offsite from 10-7pm during the week. I'll come Monday and chat in person - twas thinking of this as still coming Mondays and for events, still collaborating on projects as planned, and of course coming by to hang out as I miss yinz:) 

On the other hand, more on how to participate with upcoming projects soon!
okay, I don't want to rush if there are concerns.

As we're going to bring the rest of my stuff from my old office on Monday, he'll be around to say hello and join us for the Show & Tell. I also sent the questions to him.
The swing was a nice idea, but nowdays it seems, it doesn't have a relevance anymore. So it seems like date just hanging, blocking the calendar. That why I would suggest to take it out of the calendar, and swing like meetings happen on a informal bases.
any comments?

Another thing-
David Huerta visited us at the last show+tell two weeks ago.
He told about NYCResistor, a collaborative space in NY. Some interesting thing is that they make the rent with workshops. Members of the space, they don't really do coworking there, I would say it's more like a community shared fablab, with more workshops.
Members are obligated to do workshops, forgot how many, or otherwise pay themselves out. so part of the workshop money goes to the holder the other part to the space.

I thought of lacunians could hold workshops and maybe people we invite. for free or shares whatever we decide. an incentive for outsiders could be that they could attend a couple of workshops for free. teaching, learning, inspiriing...

also I think we need to find to way to maybe get people who work here as residents included and idea sharing process.  No more tools or email list. maybe we could open up hackpads for that.
let's remove the swing from the calendar or at least, change the recurring date to something like once in a month.

As far as I know workshops have always been a part of the idea behind Lacuna. Though, I think it is a process to get there, especially when you want people to say something good about it afterwards. You have to prepare, announce and perform them. Not to forget the subsequent works. We already had some very promising experiments. The problem is to find someone who feels responsible for it. Maybe another SC is a good idea. Something like SC Events & Collaboration where we can discuss and suggest what is happening next, how things should be happening etc. and to give everything a decent structure for growing. This could be done on a hackpad, in real meetings, on Trello etc.

That's my two cents + I support this initiative :)
I also agree that swing seems to be too unspecific to have it fixed on everybody's calendar every other weekend. However, one of the thing meant for the swing day was to clean the space, and I think we need a better solution for what we have now, which relies on just a few of us maintaining the space.

I can understand we all have tons of things to do and stressed out about our own deadlines, so it might be hard for people to volunteer to clean the shared space. So I want to propose to have a cleaning man/lady once every week to clean the shared area - the kitchen, the toilet and the ground. So we have a nice and clean place to work in. Though, I still think people should clean their own dishes and cups. It would be quite scary to have dishes stacked up for a days or even weeks. (And sadly despite the sticker in the sink, used cups are still accumulating...)
What do you think?
Some fantastic points in this thread!

My understanding of the point of the Swing is that it included a few different things: in addition to cleaning and tidying, more of an emphasis on improving the space (putting up shelves, curtains, etc.) but also a regular occasion for doing things together (even projects) in the midst of hectic schedules. Maybe someone can jump give more clarity on what the main idea is, but if the above is correct I wouldn't be behind getting rid of it altogether unless it is (already) replaced by something else. But monthly would be ok.

I agree with Mei-Fang that the space should always be clean and tidy. I always figured hiring a cleaner would be a good solution otherwise it falls to a handful of people which isn't really fair. Regarding the sink area specifically, we could also consider Wischi's original proposal to get a dishwasher.

Workshops: Yes, they were always part of the initial vision. Arturo's doing openFrameworks workshops, right? I'm definitely behind workshops as a way to pay the rent. There's the obvious model: the workshop giver pays Lacuna for the time/space used, but only in the case that the workshop makes money. All Lacunans benefit because it's possible that membership fees could go down through this. Though the pricing should incentivise actually giving workshops. Also, as we were saying before, workshops need to be in line with what we do at Lacuna. And, of course, balanced with Lacunans needing to use the space. Yeah, an SC is definitely a good idea here.

@Ramin - Re: "also I think we need to find to way to maybe get people who work here as residents included and idea sharing process.  No more tools or email list. maybe we could open up hackpads for that."

By residents, do you mean long-term Lacunans or short-term residents? Would like to understand more of this idea.
Another way to make some money is to apply for funding. Actually, tomorrow is a meeting about proper applications for money from the recently created City Taxe in Podewil. This money is a unique opportunity where the city of Berlin is explicitly giving money to independent projects of the Freie Szene. It would be very interesting to see if we can apply for that money or what we have to do to apply in the upcoming period. 
Agree with all of the above! Just wanted to add my 2 cents about one aspect of the Swings I was hoping to see and which could take their place if still a monthly (and/or voluntary Sunday appearance), especially if removing the setup / cleanup needs to other times or tasks:

Collaborative Project Days 
• a more internal kind of workshop/hack day/jam with a joint project in mind
• those who show up could propose and vote
• e.g. a GPS to get you lost, smart textiles, Spektrum exhibition starting, joining our Be Another Lab Berlin work days, ...

Discussions 
• to encourage philosophizing, getting to know areas of research, creative processes
• Sarah, you had mentioned a while ago some nice ideas of how to fuel these in an engaging way?
• playful formats: roundtables, unconferences, etc.
• e.g. around broad questions or themes (Space, Time, Intelligences, Futures, Information)

Perhaps these could be open to outsiders if we directly invite them, but main goal could be for us as a collective to inspire common ground?
They may motivate ideas for workshops, and more public-facing events as well down the line..
Does anyone have a video camera (small/easy to use is great, preferably able to record at least an hour at a time) that I could borrow for a few days, to shoot some video for a performance, and then to record the performance on Saturday?
we had another Show & Tell on Monday. Derk was happy to join us and introduced himself a little bit. I'm sure it's still hard to know anybody from just a couple of hours, but I hope this could at least erase the phantom image of him in your mind.

Of course we didn't discuss the topic of subletting in front of him. So after a few of you had the chance to meet him, I would like to ask all of you again, if there are still concerns or anything else we should discuss?
If there are no further questions or comments until the end of Saturday, I would like to let him join us on Monday.

Besides the general question of having him around, there is also the question of how he should pay rent and what key he could have? 
I just talked to Abe and we agreed it would be best, if he paid Lacuna directly and setup a proper contract to make it more transparent for everybody. 
Additionally I would like to have another upstairs key made for him as suggested during the Show & Tell. Carolina needs another one too, so I'll have 2 keys made in total. Anybody else? I know Wischi liked to have a new lock installed instead. But it's hard to tell when this is going to be realized. It's only two more keys to have one for everybody, so I think it's okay to get these now.
What do you think?
it was nice to meet him,
for completeness I created an anonymous doodle. Don't vote if you are fine. no if you're not.
He should for sure have a contract and it's okay that he gets a key for for the lab. I think gate-keys are only for permanents, but not sure.
Thanks Ramin! Where can I find the doodle? Am I missing something?
Gate keys are at least harder to make. We'd need permission from the land lord. Also the place to have them made is almost outside Berlin. But luckily Derk wouldn't need one. He'd be using the Lab between 10am and 5pm during the week.

Hey Wischi, I like the idea of a more secure lock! We discussed it shortly in a SC. How can we decide on this?
Yes, let's still have a Swing once in a month and please set a more obligatory time for it. It's more motivating, if everybody starts together!
Unfortunately I only attended a few times, but found it hard to figure out the best time for showing up. When would people be there? Once nobody showed up after all. :(

I wouldn't mind hiring a cleaner and having a dish washer! Can we afford it?
I guess you are asking because of the Derk doodle.
That was a anonymous doodle, where the participants are specified in the beginning only in order to make sure that there is only one vote by each of them. I copied the mail addresses from here:

anyway, that doodle was only to vote a "no", so if you would go for a "yes" which i highly suspect there is no need for you.

the doodle was created 3 days ago. normally there is one week to wait. so far nobody voted "no".
I would say Derk can join already. In case somebody would still vote "no"- shit hits the fan 
I'm not talking about money only here.
More about open events / free or paid workshops and creating a workshop culture.  These workshops must not be high end -let me show you something,  but also intros to certain topics and participatory /experimentation events.
Also the idea of having people from outside to give them and then allow them to participate in a number of events.

Ok swing once per month sounds like a consensus.  I'm gonna set to the 1.sun of a month.

There could also be a separate cleaning day. Not sure about the finances.  Who really is?
As a month passed by and my contract is about to end. There is time to decide for everyone if you want to keep me or not.
From my point, I totally feel home, as I think we are doing the same kind of art. None collaborative project started yet, but some in the process of becoming and others from outside joint already. So there is much more to come, from each others experience, new ideas and plenty of motivation.

I would like to ask for a decision, so I can make plans for the next weeks. The decision should also include some thoughts where I can actually have a permanent desk, as my hidden spot was just temporary.

Hopefully I can stay, but a ‚no‘ wouldn’t lead to eternal hate :P
I could start an anonymous vote like usual already but I think another permanent member would only go into the elevator room or after an rearrangement of the main room. He was staying at the soldering station, which didn't make the soldering people happy. but I guess he got never informed that he could go to somas place or wischi's, which turned into marcel's working place number 7.
My concern is that the more permanent we have the less flexible we are with getting residents. opinions?
Sorry I've not been terribly communicative lately, but I've been dealing with some unexpected business in the US.

As a result, I am having to extend my time here to try and get things resolved before heading back to Berlin, so I won't be back Europe-side until 28 February at the earliest.

I'm really looking forward to getting back into the swing of things there and working with everyone toward the Spektrum Exhibition (which will sneak up on us before we know it!).  It makes me happy to see the emails continue coming through, around the exhibition planning and the website development and deployment.

I unfortunately don't have a ton of free time while I'm here, but please do let me know if there's anything I can do to help on any front: planning, communication, development, or otherwise.

Hope 2016 has been courteous to everyone so far, and see you in a little over a month.
I'm updating the spreadsheet with all the members on lacuna and the period and space they are using.

So please, I need to know your plans for next months: If you will be at lacuna, if you are traveling for some weeks, or if you won't be at lacuna at all. Unless up until July.
Yesterday at the SC meeting it seemed like a few more people were interested in knowing more about the insurances. So here are the offers they sent us. I'm happy about everybody joining us at reading and discussing this in detail.

It doesn't seem like we need a new offer by them, since these are rather general proposals and not official offers. Nothing to sign in these papers.
I just wrote a tiny randomizer (see the screenshot) to create a list for cleaning the toilet & kitchen. I'll shift myself to the first for the toilet as I assume nobody would be so pleased to be the one to clean the toilet which hasn't been cleaned for a long time. aBe requested to be the last one as he has been doing a lot of improvement and cleaning around there. So here is the result.
I will finally be back in Berlin as of next week. Arriving on 2nd so should be around later next week.
Thanks for updating the members list Carol, sounds like lacuna is getting full. I will be doing my usual 'Berlin for a few weeks and then traveling' for feb - July. But have a few projects that I'll be working in at lacuna so hoping to have as much time there as possible :)
Has been exciting seeing all the emails, can't wait to be back.
Great to see orient carpets are included.  Makes me consider to bring one. My main question would be how we proof that we owned something and kept it lacuna in a case something happens. 
I definitely don't have the bill for all my things flying around.  Also probably not all expensive stuff. But I'll have a closer read and then we might have short exchange of all readers.
It was easy to proof ownership, when I took an insurance from that company last time. You need to buy a daily newspaper, makes pictures with the newspaper and the object on the same picture and send it to the company at the beginning of the contract. That's it.

So the Betriebsinhalt automatically includes the 1000€ (and I hope per person … we should ask again). I'm not sure, but assume professional/private doesn't matter. We were then talking about another insurance (Elektronikversicherung) that is not included in this email, since they needed more information. It covers all professional electronics and valuable things. The two insurances kind of overlap … we have to figure this out! 

Let's make a comparing list:

Betriebsinhalt
- we name a value in total, I think. 
- electronics are only included up to a certain amount and as far as I remember only if it's kaufmännisch, like PCs to do the accounting
- stationary only

Elektronik
- we name values per item in a long long list.
- this is made for electronics and expensive stuff. It covers rented stuff acquisitions and in advance.
- mobile insurance is possible
- it even covers accidents and stupidity

Feels like we need Betriebsinhalt with a low value like 20.000€ for Lacuna stuff in general. And then Elektronik based on the items values which mostly belong directly to the members. I could imagine there could be huge differences between the members. If that's a problem we could uncouple those costs from the rent each member pays.

I already have this Elektronikversicherung for my stuff and like it a lot. It's an okay price, I think. And you get (and pay for) replacement values, not time values. In case the building burns down you "just" go and buy new things. I had to make a list with serial numbers, the values and newspaper photos of the things I didn't have receipts for. In the list I could define per item wether I wanted it to be insured in up to 3 stationary places/addresses or mobile within EU, within Europe or worldwide (mobile is more expensive of course). It also covers acquisitions (and as far as I can remember, rented equipment) to a certain amount in advance, so it's usually enough to update the list once in a year. Price is 0,6% – 1,2% of the insured value per year.
In this case, does it make sense that each of us has her/his own
Elektronik insurance? Some may want mobile, some not, and I can imagine
the list being very long and "frequently" changing.

What are the pros/cons of having one for all, or each their own?
Today ​I've been writing them again answering their questions about the Elektronikversicherung. I hope that they might have a better deal for us ​as Verein.

If they end up offering us the same insurance as I have, I think generally everybody could have their own insurance. But the minimum fee is 125€ per year. Maybe people exceeding this could make their own contract and everybody else get's it as a group?
Two more points for people who weren't in the meeting -

1. "Toilet area" covers also the entrance + sofa area
2. We agreed that the person who is in duty this week will inform the person in duty next week as soon as they finish their task. 

I've just finished the toilet area yesterday and realize it might be better if the two person in duty do the entrance + sofa area together as:
1. it is more fun to have someone to chat with :)
2. easier to move the sofa and stuff around when vacuum cleaning the floor (i can't move the sofa on my own)
3. "toilet + sofa area" feels quite a lot for one person to deal with, while kitchen area is rather easy

But I'll leave it for you guys to decide :).

Here is the updated list with everybody on the list. If at the end Peter and Nuno won't be joining us, I'll remove their names from the list manually.
Can you share a link with more information about the Elektronikversicherung? Their premiums seem super low. When I checked insuring electronics a few years ago, it was more between 8 and 15% of the value per year which is of course to high.
Nuño helped me with some tricky parts, so I've been able to fix the grid of the website mostly. Though, it's not optimized everywhere for smaller screens yet.
We spent a good amount of time designing the mockup and I think it's well thought-through. So for the upcoming development, it would be great, if these could be respected. The best and easy way I know, is to use browser plugins like PerfectPixel, which add images as overlays to the page. It's then easy to compare the mockup to the current state of the site and be truly pixel perfect. 
But of course, if something in the mockup is weird or doesn't fit to our needs, feel free to start a discussion about it or ask Aurelia, Thomas or me!
From the description it's either Rudiger who started the the Soma lab(I've sent an email about it once) or someone else involved in it.

Marc founded Hackteria but he lives in Switzerland, I doubt it was him. He was here for a week and I helped him organize biohack promo evening in Spektrum.

Anyway, it's a great idea to invite this mysterious person for show'n'tell to clear it all out:) It would be great to have some biohacking workshops in Lacuna!

Btw, if you are into bioworkshops there is going to be one during transmediale about building bio-propellers. It's by Howard Boland from c-lab in uk - I went to two of his workshops and they were fun! That's where I first met Sarah&Eliot&Ramin:)
If he said that he talked to me about space in Lacuna last Febuary, then it’s Rudiger.  While our group was still looking for a location for Lacuna, he and I were in touch about the possibility of their bio hack-lab being a part of ours (kindof like how Cyborgs are part of Lacuna, but they would have needed an entire room).  I’m glad that they found somewhere else for their lab that worked out, it was a pity we didn’t have enough space for them. 

I‘d very much be in support of letting them to hold some workshops and talks here at Lacuna, while they are waiting for their space to be ready. 
Who has set up the voting in the past, so that we can get the ball rolling with it?  

We are still trying to figure out where he could put a permanent desk (and if there is actually room), but we can at least decide officially if we want him as a permanent member.  Then once he is ‘confirmed/approved’ as a member, we can offer him permanent part-time for now (no fixed desk other than what’s available month to month, like Soma’s currently).  This place is a work-in-progress, and hopefully in the near future we can work out a permanent spot for him.   But in the mean time, let’s not make him wait to know if he is in or out.  

Also I think he’s really nice and talented and is a great addition to Lacuna.
So to summarize all the proposed points + my proposal:

1. Peter will use Soma's desk temporarily in February

2. We'll set up a vote to decide if we want Peter to become a member

3. If we want Peter to stay, we'll have a short meeting to see if we have the space for another fixed desk. If the answer is NO, what do we do with Peter. (@Carolina: do we have the spreadsheet ready? It would be useful to take a look at it when discussing the space issue)

What do you think? If nobody is against the idea, I can set up an anonymous vote for Peter & arrange a time for (3) (maybe we can hijack 15 minutes from the exhibition meeting to talk about it?).
Hi there, maybe I'm out of the know, but once you vote on Peter and if he stays, he'd probably be happy to be involved in the discussion on where he sits, no? Maybe I didn't understand something, but sounds like you feel you need all the answers now for where, but is it also possible to move forward in smaller steps? Worst case scenario: you want him, don't have a permanent space, he say no --- but that is ok too. As some people have mentioned, the desire to keep him is separate from if you have space, and with these two things, he can decide what is best for himself....
Seems like the company needs a confirmation via e-mail only. Could a chairman please send this back to them? Don't know if I'm legally authorized to do it. Just forward this conversation, or attach the contract and say we like to activate it. (Which is basically what I already asked him)
If the project ideas are still relevant, would a like-grid still be useful, as proposed in december? What I mean is a grid with project ideas as columns, and people as rows, and you can tick the projects that you'd like to work on - seemed a missing link from projects ideas to actual execution was selecting projects and clustering into teams, and such a grid could help with decision making. I'd be happy to make one, perhaps on doodle, but I'd like to understand the current planning approach you all are using.
everything is still relevant. :) The next step is to distill one idea everyone can somehow identify with (from all the material we have collected so far). Therefore, I think your proposed like-grid could be very useful. We're planning to have a meeting on Sunday to make some further conceptual work. Feel free to join us.
There was some mention of meeting at Lacuna to head over together, just wanted to mention I'm in Mitte so sounds like I'll be heading over a bit earlier directly from here with the others. If we can find each other after the talks, we should all grab a drink after and/or see the exhibition! Not sure as I've never been myself before, but the others here mentioned it starts at 7 and it's good to be early as they get full.
Would be cool to have some more people in the discussion there! It seems like this is another crucial part where we figure out what Lacuna actually should be.

When should I summarize the thoughts and send it to them? I would not like to drag this behind for another few weeks. And meanwhile Lacuna still doesn't have an insurance … So how about a deadline at Sunday night.
I enjoyed the party yesterday for a couple of hours. It was nice to see all this crazy and interesting stuff happening at Lacuna. At a certain point I became kind of worried though. It's been quite a few people in there after a couple of hours and I became afraid, things could be damaged or even disappear.
Before I left, Aurelia and I put Arturo's MacBook and small PC in Soma's shelves. I also took the white projector from a rather exposed spot and put it near Soma's desk.

I'm writing, because I think we need to discuss larger events again. 
When the inplant/explant party was announced, I didn't think of it as such a big event. And as most things were left from Lacunans as normal, I guess other didn't expect it either.
It came to my mind that last time, when we talked about workshops, we agreed to a maximum of 15 participants (and as far as I remember a min. ratio of Lacunans vs. visitors was suggested). It was also suggested to lock the small rooms rooms as safe area for expensive or fragile things. 
This time the inplant/explant zone, which was kind of the purpose for this whole evening, was put in the porner room. It probably totally made sense, to safely and calmly to do the stuff back there. But it also attracked people to those small rooms.

I'm simply wondering why we worry about safety during workshops and then party in those rooms without preparing it properly (at least I felt like my desk was not prepared for this). I don't judge anything or anybody. But let's please discuss on Monday, how we could improve this next time.
I've got this shelf, which could be used in the main or storage room.
The shelf in the main room currently has a few card board boxes flying around, that look project related. Maybe stuff like that could fit in there nicely. Everybody could occupy and label a few shelf boxes as needed.
Within the next few weeks I'll probably have a chance to use a rented transporter and could bring it to Lacuna.

What do you think? Let's discuss it tomorrow at the SC meeting!
I must say I'm very disappointed. We were three days working on painting our room, taking every piece of furniture out and in again. Trying to make the space nicer.
We arrive this morning and is a piece of shit, all dirty again, I have to clean all my desk, all  the balcony with empty bottles, cups.

This is not a club, at least I expect my desk and our room is not.

I have things to work on besides cleaning beer on my desk, and try to clean the air for the terrible smell, having  the window open on winter for one hour.

I hope we can tall about this and about who is responsable for security of out stuff when there is so many people outside from lacuna using the space without advice.

Of course as Arturo said I expect the floor to be on the conditions we left it on Thursday by the end of this week, and I'm not cleaning the toilet this week.
I also remember discussions about voting where we said anonymous voting can't work in principle for those reasons. If one member feels like someone shouldn't join, (s)he should discuss her/his reasons with everyone (and feel supported to do so). Therefore, being anonymous in the first place makes no sense. Unfortunately, I don't think this reasoning was shared with everyone at the time but better late than never.
You might be right.  I looked into the hackpad it only says "vote". I don't know if that vote would then run with the same procedure as other votes- and how that precisely is. Further discussion is happening right  now ;) and could also be in an all-hands or board meeting.
Well If there is a vote about a person you don't feel comfortable with, that might be enough to change the mood climate if that person gets in anyway.
Or if you feel like the space gets  uncomfortable packed if more people join,  then also a respectable position.
Non of these is the case.  I like peter and I don't think the space if packed yet - but almost. I voted no, since I think there is a developer dominance in the space already and I would like to see members background more diverse.  E.g. design,  film making,  musician. ...
Also the space is basically on the limit of permanent members with 1 or 2 places left maybe so we should not rush to fill them up.
Anyway,  10 of 18 voted, which is n ot alot for such a decision, so I don't know if there is strong yes from all the people who know him if that's the case I would give in and let him join the space 

I will try to start today with that. actually yours and nenads input would valuable since you were the only two who joined afterwards so far.

okay, but vereinsmembership and permanent member of the space would be something differen then right? I think we all like the idea of having residents or friends involved as an extended part of the lacunalab people network, we don't have infrastructure for that yet, there shold be still a mailinglist for members only. maybe a hack/etherpad could do it. maybe its not necessary at all. if they would join as vereinsmitglieder would be a formal option. not sure what the advantage would be tho.
Good of you to be open about your 'No' vote. Actually, from what I know, Peter's main background is physics, and then computing but, not to split hairs. Good that you're considering also formal reasons for taking new people on such as skill sets we're lacking. We should talk about this further. But I agree with Jerry that this should already be agreed before even taking someone on as a resident to not give false hope.
welcome back and welcome on board.
After a discussion about the skill diversity in the space, we decided to welcome you as a permanent member.
there are some formal things, space contract for a longer period, vereins membership (or are you already member?) and eventual key contract- but its not clear if you can get a gate/house key already, since every new key, needs to be verified by the mietgesellschaft.
there is also a trello board I added you to and a hackpad- which will be replaced hopefully soon. feel free to look around. there will be more details soon.
I am really glad to hear that we will go our artistic adventures together. There is lot of projects already approaching. I will present more of my work soon, so you can have better insight of what we can do together.
Sorry … ! Since we are looking for a new lock anyway and the whole deposit situation is not evened out yet, I thought it would be okay to only write this mail as interim solution. But sure, we never know how long it will take us to get the new lock.
I hope the organizer can come over to take care of the cleaning asap. At lacuna we've finally agreed on the cleaning schedule, but because of this unresolved issue people are refusing to do their duties. it would be really sad to see this effort in keeping the place tidy ended in vain.
Sorry for the mass email, but I'm trying to put the word out in case anyone knows of anything: I'm searching for housing starting around April (also would love to hear if there are things after as well) as my current subletter is coming back to town... Thanks ahead of time!
fter the all hands meeting of lacuna yesterday we decided that it's necessary to update you about the guidelines of how to run public events and clearance how cyborgs and lacuna relationship is defined.
There are a few members of lacuna who want to meet with you for that.  I added stefan,  since he hosts pnp when Enno can't.
Are you available Wednesday, maybe 1h before pnp. If not please find a date in this thread.
This is a draft for guidelines running a workshop or similar public events.
judging from my recent visit, the dish/glasses-in-the-sink situation is not dire for normal functioning of the lab, but just in case it's interesting especially as an easy practical solution to exceptional situations, I searched for small dish washers on kleinanzeigen, and they seem to come up with some regularity, some under 50 eur.
fortunately I did most of the points naturally on our normal meetings except clearing the main table before a meeting and putting away the bills. Fort that I need to know, where the hidden box is, I didn’t heard of by now.

I don’t think, any of us use glasses - always bottle that I put away in the evening. As well guest use leave in some money when they take bottles, but I regularly I throw in 5-10 Euro on my behalf and for not paying guests.

Wed at 7pm is fine to me! Will you be there, too?
it went well. :) We started structuring some ideas and thoughts into concrete ideas. There are still a lot of notes on the chalk board that are looking for a caretaker. Take a look there to see how, where and to whom you (and the others that weren't present) can connect to.

We also started a Project board on Trello to better organize the work in the teams that have already formed and the things that have to be done in general.
it's my birthday on Sunday. I would like to invite all of you to whatever is going to happen at Saturday night. Don't know yet wether this should be a party or not. What do you think? :)
It's probably going to happen at my shared appartment at Siegfriedstraße 44 in Neukölln. I'll send you more info soon.
I know I'm in charge of cleaning the kitchen. 
But since a couple of days a lot of work is piling up on my desk, which I can't postpone. I didn't expect this to happen, but I'm actually glad if I can finally earn some money.
Well, I'm probably not going to be able to clean before mid of next week. So in case someone feels like it needs to be done before, I need to ask if there is somebody who would like switch shifts with me!?
I actually already switched with Sarah in the first place. Sorry for all this.
Nenad cleaned the kitchen on Saturday. I told him that it was his turn by mistake (sorry!). Could you please put your name at a slot when you absolutely can do it? 

I also want to take this opportunity to remind everyone that it would be really appreciated if you know you can't work on the duty in your week, please announce it ASAP and find someone to swap the time with you. I believe it's quite unlikely to find someone on very short notice.
Has been a while but I am back in Germany (for a bit).  Should be back at Lacuna next week and looking forward to seeing everyone.

I would like so use the storage space under the loft to set up something for filming.  I want to be able to control the light so this is ideal as I can block out most of the natural light. 
Is everyone ok if I take over this space for most of March?  I am not entirely sure how long this will take but hoping 3 - 4 weeks should be enough.

I ran this by a few people when I made a brief visit a couple of weeks ago but want to check with everyone if this is ok.  Let me know!
I am totally up for him staying!
He usually anyway stays at the middle desk
(And its a good opportunity to find out, what crazy project he is working on)
tomorrow is the next meeting for our exhibition planning. Please join!

On Friday's exhibition opening in Spektrum, I had the chance to talk to Lieke briefly. They expect us to send some preview material and texts for their website within the next two weeks.

So, we better hurry and start doing something. This also means we need a working website they can refer to.
So sorry to hear that, Arturo!  We will miss you and Carolina's presence in the space!  

Glad that you may still keep involved as non-permanent, or with workshops, events, etc.  Would be so sad for you both to disappear completely from the community! 
I would also go with a minimum effort solution at this point as we need the official email address set up quite soon.

Where are we planning to host the site? Better not someone's personal hosting I would say since anyone working on the site should have access.
We thought about having the meeting next Tuesday at 5 pm. Soma and I will definitely be there. Anyone else is free to come. The meeting is already on the calendar. Could you ask Alfredo to come?
the next cyborg meeting will be on Friday. We plan to watch the movie „Operation Naked“ and the documentary „Ich weiß, wer du bist“ I worked on as production manager last year. The movie is about how society would react on smart glasses with that everybody could know anything about anyone. The documentary is about how realistic that scenario is from a technological point of view. We’ll need the projector for that. Unfortunately the movie is in German and hasn’t got subtitles yet. Nevertheless anyone, who is interested, is of course invited to watch with us. The author and director Mario Sixtus will be there, too. Because both films are under CC, public screening won’t be a problem in this case. But we didn’t make a bigger public announcement for not overcrowding the space.
Yes, they need to be sequential here too! But nobody cares about the what period the invoice is about. 
You can simply use the current date for all invoices you are writing. For example you could write "Rent June 2015 – March 2016" or "Rent August 2015" in the invoice, but use 03.03.2016 as invoice date.

If this was not possible, I wouldn't even know how to write any invoice. This get's mixed up regularly. For example I often start a new project before writing an invoice for the last project.
imho what jeremias said is true. you can issue a invoice with todays date but for the rent of june 2015 no problem. it should be accepted by the tax office for people that put those invoices in their bookkeeping to.
they might ask, why we issue invoices for june 2015 now but the answer is, we are a non-profit and the people that do our bookkeeping do it voluntarily and in batches and we are just starting as an organisation.
Would it be possible to send us a short abstract + image about the exhibition, so we can post a teaser on the website? Also, we just had an interview with ExBerliner, which will come out in the April issue, and they would like to mention this exhibition in there. So if you could send it over early next week, they can include it too.
I'm super busy finishing up things in Paris, but I'm happy to do a final english review of a draft for the 100 words if there's no one else available. That means there would have to be someone else who writes it first though:)

In terms of the image, if anyone wants to turn the fan box horizontal and simulate fabric blowing (2 people flapping out of the frame) be my guest. But perhaps someone has something betteR? Be back in town late Sunday night:)
sorry for the spamming, but as you probably know, renting in Berlin is a bitch :-D . 

A friend/new colleague of mine is looking for a space to stay. She’s looking for her own flat, but for the meantime, starting a week from now, she needs somewhere to live.
I can work on writing an abstract for the show over the weekend, so anyone who has any thoughts on what they think best describes what we are doing, any key words, phrases, descriptions etc for me to consider including, please send them to me ASAP.    
Also, are there any examples anyone knows of off hand, of the sort of writing style that would work best for this?   Any suggestions would be really helpful. 
as the subject already indicates, we are having a new statute now. :)

It contains one change in §13. It now says that all of Lacunas property has to go another Verein with a cultural benefit in case of Lacunas disbanding. This is a must for being accepted by the Finanzamt. 

I put a printout on the big table in the community room. Please be so kind and sign it asap. A copy is also attached to this mail.
There’s going to be a VR hackathon in Amsterdam on April 30!  I’m probably going to buy a ticket, it would be a great way to get to know the creative coding community in Amsterdam, connect Lacuna Lab with the hosts ‘Lava Lab’,  and to experiment with VR!   Anyone else interested in coming along?  Tickets are available now but these things sell out pretty fast (remember the Science Hack Day and how fast those vanished?)  
this thursday we invited Michael Seeman (mspro) to give a talk about „Platforms vs. State“. His last book „das neue Spiel“ is about the post Snowden age and his main claim is that digitalization of the world has changed the basic mechanics of how things work, i.e. society. The main issue: We cannot control the flow of data and information in the way that we used to.
So, thursday evening we’ll discuss around these topics - if you are interested, feel welcome to join, start is 8 pm!
Thanks a billion! The book-keeping stuff sounds like lots of work! Do you think we can automate part of the tasks, and split the non automatable stuff among everybody so no one feels overwhelmed by this way too often?

like the kitchen and toilet cleaning tasks - everybody needs to work on it only once every 3-4 months, that's not too bad IMO :)
That has a lot of prices from Netto and Getränke Hoffmann. I will try to find a company that can deliver drinks for a reasonable price aswell.

I think 1€ is ok for us, 1,50€ for workshops and maybe 2€ for parties. We might even be able to do 80 cent for us.

Rin and I will also order a Sackkarre so that we can use that to get new drinks from Netto.

Also one thing I noticed: The problem of people bringing bottles to Lacuna and leaving them here is bigger than people taking bottles with them. But maybe that can be fixed by having beer here so people don't need to bring Späti beer.
The new place I found for empty crates is in between the two elevator doors on the right side. The Sackkarre will also live there.
Everybody up for the exhibition meeting on Tuesday? What about, in addition to status updates on the various pieces, we also can use the time to group off and work on them?
Yup, I think we need to meet for all the Exhibition Meetings we have planned so far, and probably more so too. :)

A 'round-the-room status update would be a great way to start on Tuesday, so we can get a sense of how everyone is feeling about the feasibility and vision of their projects.

And yes, we should decide whether and how the inter-project connections should work.  We've all expressed interest in the idea, but there's been no real concrete discussions about how and what would be implemented this way.

And don't forget about the All-hands Meeting tomorrow to ratify our latest version of the Satzung!
Yesterday at the SC meeting lots of organizational issues were brought up to the table. One of the thing is that there are quite a few tasks to be taken care of but they are often under the shoulder of certain people. We need to discuss how to share the tasks, by forming new workgroups or through the existing sub-committees.
We want to make sure everyone at LC is accountable for certain stuff (don't worry, most of them are as simple as ordering drinks occasionally). So please try to find a day that you can make it to the meeting. For people who can't join us physically, you can either join us via Skype/jitsi or let us know what kind of tasks you would prefer to take care of in the future.
I'm just forwarding a discussion Mei-Fang and I started to have between the two of us (and Ramin reading). Again it's about cleaning and the question when in the week one is supposed to do it. Maybe be can continue all together during one of the next meetings.
Just a quick note to say that Thomas and I have been working on some improvements to our Trello boards today. It's still in progress but some things are already clearer, e.g., lists representing SCs on the Lacuna Lab board are now all in the same "format" and we refined the SC boards and the ALL boards a bit better.
I like the idea of having a timeframe of at least 5 days and a maximum of 9 days after the last person cleaned.

What I like even more: Just paying someone to do the cleaning regularly. That's the best option imo and it fixes a lot of potential tensions.
(Cost would be around 80€ per Month if we get 2h each week, see https://www.helpling.de/preise for example)
Honestly, I favor this option too. Hiring a person for doing only the task of one Lacunan (as proposed in the meeting yesterday) is really expansive, because you'd have to pay somebody for 2 or 3 hours at least. Having somebody cleaning kitchen, bathroom and sounds good to me though!

I know there are different opinions about it and I know Mei-Fang already put a lot of energy into getting this organized and I'm thankful for her doing that.
Still I would like to ask, how we came to the cleaning schedule. In one of the earlier discussion, when the topic became priority, I remember us talking about hiring somebody. And then I think a meeting happened (which I couldn't attend to) and we had a schedule instead. So has there been a voting about this, or did simply everybody agree? I would just like to know what the majority thinks about it.

I feel like we are discussing this topic quite often and think the situation won't improve a lot. Almost all shared apartments I know of have problems with it and I would like us to keep the energy for other stuff. 
If the majority likes to keep the schedule I'm totally cool with it. Just forgot/didn't get how exactly we came to it.
Just in case you don't remember: actually that cleaning discussion/decision was initiated by me proposing to use some cleaning service in an email. But in the actual meeting we decided to give the schedule a try. Now I am just helping with executing the decision.
Additionally, I created a template for the Status report on Trello that helps you to track your progress. It contains a checklist of 11 general tasks. You can simply copy the checklist or the entire card to your project. I suggest, you add and constantly review your own milestones to make it possible for the others to follow your progress. For this reason, change the tile according to the resulting numer of the progress checklist. Take a look at the Telescope card if you want to see an example.
egarding the task list Mei mentioned: my apologies for any misunderstandings, but I was suggesting that whoever takes the lead of organizing for this upcoming meeting help by collecting a list of existing tasks (as it could speed up the meeting itself). I don't actually have a list, and I'm also quite overloaded time-wise so I'm afraid I won't be able to help with this other than adding to a list when shared. Perhaps there are others who are able to help organize this?
Good point. I already have this in hand. As long as you create a card on any of our boards on Trello, apply the pink "Task" label and a priority label, it will be included for the meeting (with code magic). So...anything anyone things needs doing, make sure it's on Trello with those labels and it will be dealt with during the meeting.

If you're unsure of anything, reply to this thread.

P.S. Use the black "Recurring task" label instead of the pink "Task" label for...well, recurring tasks.
Yes, thanks to Thomas for setting up some framework for us, and to Marcel for being our point-of-contact.

Really looking forward to the ideas crystallizing into real-live projects. :)

This exhibition is our first major impression of Lacuna Lab on the creative tech community of Berlin--let's make it something we can all be proud of!
Not coming in tomorrow. Have to go buy a baby Fahrradanhanger in Prenzi. Leaving about 9:30. You probably not up early enough to come by and pick it up? Like around 9am? In Liegnitzer Str
We followed the agenda as set out by Marcel. One question was whether the Greenhouse will make it into the exhibition. The outcome was: YES. And it needs support from everyone. This Sunday is a Lacuna Swing so we plan to use this to prototype the Greenhouse. At this point the idea is a hanging tube that you can stick your head into to look at what's inside.
I wrote a script to randomise the roles (moderator, time-keeper, note-taker) in our meetings and make sure the same person doesn't get stuck with the same role all the time. So far it's in the Spektrum Exhibition spreadsheet on the Meetings sheet.
a few already know and I just want to let everybody know, that my plans of going abroad start to become more specific. 
We plan to leave Germany around the beginning of August to live, work and travel in New Zealand for around 12 months. We didn't apply for visa yet and don't have flight tickets. But it's all going to happen soon and it seems like there is a very low chance of anything going wrong with it. Which is good! :) As always with these things, I'll leave with a crying and a laughing eye and miss you and the space of course. But I'm very much looking forward to face new adventures on the other side of the planet for a while.

So I'll be out for a while and there will be a free desk for that time.
I guess there are a few things to discuss, like how to offer a place to another person with me being able to return? What kind of stuff I should remove from Lacuna and what could be useful for others? And worst case, what if I needed to come back earlier … ?

Let's discuss it within the next weeks. 
Maybe at a less packed SC meeting or some other time.
Hi peeps, just lettin ya'll know that i cant come tonight. im still stuck in wannsee finishing up some work.. enjoy everybody, ill try to stop by a little later.
So, as nobody is there today, when does anybody plan to go over tomorrow? I'm working during the day again and would come in the evening. 7pm or so.
seems like i dont have access to the doc there, can u grant some plz :)

im already on my way back home so see you asap.
There's a relaxed hangout tonight I go to regularly and I thought I might share it with you, I'd be happy to meet some of you there.
I don't think there is anything big settled, yet. i think there's much space downstairs for more desks, maybe even in the loft?? im wondering, a small desk for uninterrupted coding could be good there. 
altogether i think we gotta test some constellation out and adopt over the next days/weeks..

I wasnt in the lab today, cause im sick, so I dont know what all happened today. one thing i wanted to express is that i would be in general upset if almost every piece of space would be covered in tables, what would make it hard to do anything else than sit in the space. but we will figure it out, maybe we dont even need to many individual tablea as we can share some among us. lets see! :)
Another thing: Just wanting to let everybody know that I took the one left over backyard- and housekey for now. My usual schedule to come here is pretty late, so I might do the nightwatch now and then and would feel much better with having a key at the moment, so I dont stand in front of closed doors.

If anybody needs to get in late, drop me a message and I'll let you know weather I'm here orwhere to meet me to get the key, when I'm not around. 
I'll be renting a car on wednesday early afternoon and gonna bring a couple of small things to the space. Including a shelf I would sort of put into public hands in the space.

Enno, did you have the chance to get a picture of the chairs you were talking about?

Anybody else ohne Fahrschein and want me to pick something up?
just a quick one for anybody interested. im celebrating my birthday tonight a little. whoever feels like joining is happily invited to come over to my place in neukölln. 
I finally reached Mrs. Zander from Taekker regarding the hof keys. I've attached the document she sent me, with which we can go to the named keyservice and just get them copied ourselves. We gotta inquire ourselves how much one copy would be, though.

Who wants another key? Just drop me a mail on the weekend and I'll inform everybody about how many we're getting and how much one copy would cost on monday.
The doors can sometimes be closed, like yesterday evening, somebody locked the housedoor and the cyborgies couldnt enter. Luckily I was here and opened up.

Deposit system.. yeah. Why don't you make a suggestion. I'm not entirely sure I get your point... sorri :]
Sorry for spamming, but I just wanted to inform all of you that I am still in the process of getting the insurance sorted out for our space.

I have sent more detailed pictures and information about how to enter the space and so forth to my Makler and it seems to be in a annoyingly slow process, I really have no clue why it's not just a simple document.

An issue that popped up for me are the 'insecure' windows in the pornroom and the sleek office next to it. The fact that it's sorta easy to get onto the roof with a ladder and then potentially easy to break in, makes it an issue I don't want to ignore. Was the one window broken from since we started renting it? Should I contact Teakker about the whole situation and that we feel insecure with that? 
I will join you, bruv. Plus, there's prolly too much to discuss than what we can do in a usual ~2h general meeting. So maybe we can do it in a more smooth way, but longer? Somehow?
Did anybody already call the person and said that we want it? If not tell me ASAP and I call the person. I will ask for address and available times, so either you by foot or me by car on Friday can pick it up. Unfortunately I can't come over during the day today to help and hang out. Shoutout to the pupils!
I just got to the space and the window was wide open. Keep in mind we're not (yet) insured and so on. And i doubt the insurance would cover anything when anybody can just 'walk' in the space.

Apart from that, I'm getting keys tomorrow, so whoever wants some, gets some. But I'm still missing money from James, Arturo and Wischi. I'll get the keys anyways, hopefully I'm not ordering unwanted keys.
Sarah, Nayeli and me just found out that the money for drinks from the little treasure in the kitchen is gone, which we were gonna raid for buying some drinks for tonight. But its only a bit left, really. I suspect you, Claudine might have taken it, as Lacuna is still in dept with you regarding the drinks you bought earlier.
I'm sorry in case I ask questions regarding something that's already been sorted out, as I was gone for a week, but nobody else around knows either. 
I believe this sunday will be kind of an exception, as the OF group will meet all sunday, too. Don't get me wrong, but maybe it'll be slightly crowded already and we're sort of doing internal organization etc at the swing. At least it was the last time I attended, 1 month ago.
is anybody of you looking for a freelance job? It's a commercial installation that involves holographic gaze projection to be developed, analog punching cards to be analyzed, visuals to be coded and so on. It sounds all pretty sweet, but I'm currently too busy to take it. Holler at me in case this could be something for you. I'd classify it as a job that requires pretty advanced knowledge and experience.

I wouldn't say no to a collaborative thing, but I can't do it by myself at the moment. 
does anybody have time later around 6-7pm to help me carry a lasercutter to the lab? Its bigger and heavier than I expected and I'm worried of breaking it when trying to do it by myself. I've got a Sackkarre to support a little bit, but that thing doesn't really help on Kopfsteinpflaster, which we have in our backyard.

Anyways, it would be cool and we would have to carry it from Senefelder Platz (U2) via the underground.
No worries, Alex helped me out. Yeh, but I gotta get some security glasses first and then go through the setup of the thing. It's not that easy but that makes it usable for anything. The thing sorta gotta go in either the porner or the carpet room, because it's gotta be close to a window..
Unfortunately I doubt it'll be in operation before you leave.
I'm well aware of the fact that this is a laser that can cut things. Currently there's a sign on it to not use it, so we're all safe.

Cheers for the safety switch. But I guess we could just make it a rule to not open it, while the thing is lasering, huh? We're all sorta grown up, aren't we? ;)

I'll get some glasses anyway.

There is software shipped with it. I haven't had the chance to put my hands on it, yet, but I heard from the former owner, that it's a cracked version of Corel Draw, that has a plugin to control the machine with. And it's secured with a usb dongle, which is hilarious already.
I will inspect the device on friday or saturday. I have detailed info about how to use it, but it would be good if you could join, when you got some spare time on a friday eve? ;)
There's lots to figure out, lets talk in person though. Let me know when it suits you :)
as some of you might have noticed already, we've got a laser in the house now. I've just moved it to the carpet room in the corner because there's a window nearby, two doors to keep the smell at least only in one room and arturo and carolina are not there at the moment.

The thing works almost perfect but it has a major downside: smell. It's not that it smells like the devil himself, but it can't be denied it leaves a trace. It's burning material in the end.. so..
But I'm in the process of optimizing the air ventilation, lets see how that goes.

I remember us having the rough plan to keep this room as somewhat of a working room, where it can be noisy/smelly/dirty. Needless to say its the opposite right now, which is actually fine with me, but I wonder what the overall mindset about a rather dirty piece of equipment is. Do we have space/capacity to do these kinda things? I'm the last who wants to annoy people with what I do, let's discuss how we could handle that..

I've been asked by Ramin to create a trello card and start a vote. Maybe there's some space for general comments on this before and then I'll set up a vote for whatever options we're coming up with.
damn, looks like one neat lasercutter. there's a fire extinguisher at lacuna already.. i ordered one.
apart from that i got a new ventilator, more tubes and so on. i'll see and get it to lacuna soon and give it a go. i'm not sure i got a strong enough vent (it was 20 instead of 1000€) but we'll see. i got a plan about air filtering too, which ill check out soon.
I can just second that, the scope sessions are always very nice, and in-depth sessions. It's usually not too crowded, which makes it a good platform to actually talk a bit about some stuff. Plus the entire posse who's hosting it is a cool bunch.
we've just had our kickoff meeting regarding our lacuna exhibition. We would love to do this, I just wanted to get back to you and inquire about the possible dates for that event. Another question that arose is, if we could do a two or possibly three days, where each day would include a different theme, a different aspect of our collective being exposed.
I'm writing to happily invite you all to a lasercutting workshop. The machine is now operating again and I don't want to hide it from you, that's why I would like to invite everybody who's interested to check it out. And possibly to put some drawings and whatnot onto acrylic glass, wood, leather and anything else except mdf. Figuring out how to get it more under control would be something nice too. Generative approaches are possible.
All kinds hacks with the thing should be possible, so whoever wants to take things to the edge is warmly welcomed. I'm thinking like even directly controlling the thing in real-time with a graphics tablet or so. Shouldn't be impossible, I suppose.

I'll get tons of small acrylic glass pieces to use. They're almost free- see the image attached.
Well, when the workshop happens, I would take part I think. Though I'd be a little more interested in a general introduction to FreeCAD, though that might be when he's explaining his polygon kit.

Go ahead with the meetup thing, maybe somebody else is interested, too.

Show'n'tell on monday- yeah. I'll be there giving ma feedbackz.
I'm writing to give some feedback about the yesterdays SC meetings.

I'm happy Peter will join, I think Lacuna is the right spot for him and vice versa.

Drinks. Yeah, I'd say 1€ for everybody is fair. When buying e.g. a mate bottle for 50cents it should be fine for everybody to get it at the price of 1€. Making different prices for different people feels weird. Maybe we can adjust prices when we do a party or so?

The website seems to be taking shape, Soma did some massive start, that I've checked out yesterday. It's available here: https://github.com/LacunaLab/lacunalab-website
I've added some notes on how to set up the project under Ubuntu. More actual website implementation upcoming. Maybe we should have another evening of working on this soon--?

What do you need a robben&wientjes and a driver for?

Wifi- I have another wifi router, I'm not sure if it's compatible, though?

The proposed decision making is great!

Let's have a christmas party, yeah. Setting up a doodle is the way to go? 
I've already been speaking to a few of you, this idea to create some anonymous-collaborative project, that we could use for our exhibition. It's an idea where it is really important that _everybody_ gets involved.

What it essentially boils down to is the need for 10 pages of text from everybody. This text will then be fed into a recurrent neural network layed out for text. After this is done it'll be possible to extract text/poems from this that reflects all of our output. This already exciting enough to do it, isn't it? What follows after that will be up to us.
Important is that this text comes from YOU. It doesn't matter weather it's outgoing emails, diary entries, notebook notes about projects etc- all these should be sufficient to get some (semi/abstract) meaningfull output. 
 
As it might be slightly sensitive text, I came up with a way we can organize this. Say everbody who wants to join in on this, has their text ready, not everybody might be comfortable with sending this text via email to anybody (especially not to me most probably). Regarding this, I suggest to use this encryption technique.
Of course the output of these networks are up for heavy critics weather it makes sense and if yet in what degree. Eventually it might look like regular bullshit at first sight but I'm the opinion there is definately something hidden to learn something about ourselves from.
I've done some quick experiements and trained one of these networks on all of the texts of articles that I saved to read later, but eventually never did. It's trained on about 500 articles and links containing various types of texts.
So much so far, I'm already throwing this out there, as it'll probably take a while until we get this going. I'm hoping this is all clear enough and hopefully all of you are interested in this! I'll suggest this in person one of these days, maybe on monday, so everybody can ask questions and we can talk about it. 
Coolio- it might be good if all text would be one language, so I'd say we have to all agree on one. I suppose it's gonne be english

Why don't you extract some texts and we start from there, maybe we can formulate some guidelines from that. The first thing that comes to mind, is that there should be as little 'markdown' as possible and rather text, I suppose. 
thanks for all the texts, I'm looking forward to checking it out. I've got texts from 8 people(Sarah, Aurelia, Alex, Jerry, Enno, Abe, Mei, Marcel), which is great, but we need to try to include everybody.

That's why I'm extending the deadline for non-english texts until the 17.01. midnight. Yes, I would be happy to receive texts in german/spanish or any other language!
Abe has a point with what he's saying. Derk is probably not at all interested in the general culture of Lacuna, he simply wants to work on this project with Jerry. And it seems like he'll not be come a member of Lacuna either, as he's around only project-related. At the same time, it should be possible to invite external people to work on something.
I'm not sure what to think of this, but generally it does not feel nice to say 'no' to this. Plus, Aurelia is really just subletting her space, if I understand correctly. This is, if I remember correctly, part of our rules and 'allowed'- thus skipping people in the waiting list.

I would still like him to integrate with the rest of us and give feedback about these questions. 
i would like to invite again everybody who attended last time, as well as those who didn't/couldn't. it's always good to get some feedback as i would suggest to have some bit more concrete ideas around, to get going, it's not that far away anymore. as well as individual ideas i would like to talk again about the general big picture, i have the feeling there are still some things to discuss and recap on. here's somas valuable notes from last time.
i havent checked our project stack for the exhibition in a while but i can see some things have been added in the meantime. would be great to have little presentations covering some things like what's necessary to create it and so on, so it's easier for people to cross-join projects.
here's the link.
Working place number seven is free for quite a while already and I have to admit, I'm not sure if I like that passive aggressiveness there.

It sure is getting full everywhere and you have a point with that flexibility for actually having proper space for residents. Though I would still vote for Peter to stay- I advised him to talk to Caroline/arturo regarding figuring out an alternative arrangement for the elevator room, so he can fit in there, too.
word up, arturo. i really don't wanna get rid of him, too.

i suppose letting him stay at soma's desk would be fine for now until we found another spot for him. a permanent one. though that would have to wait until we rearranged some things in the main room, Thomas told me you were talking about moving the big shelf somewhere else, so that corner would be free.

i've been thinking whether he could fit a desk into the elevator room somehow, but that's up for you three (wishi,arturo,carolina) in there to decide if there's space. 
This is a valid point but I think Peter would be, in general, a great addition to lacuna. Even though he's a developer by trade, I think he made it pretty clear what he's interested in. And by the way the website development went, we might even be in need for another developer :) He's also usually very interested in doing documentation, support in things and so on.
I haven't voted on the vote, as I thought it would be 'no'-only vote. So summing it up, maybe we discuss this again next monday, there seems to be some potential for that.

Fyi, I've invited him for the exhibition meeting tonigh!
if I'm not completely mistaken, the Cyborgs are in charge of cleaning this week. I am not rly aware of that happened, but they have just 'found out' two days ago after our little chat about the cleaning issue. Sooo, the whole plan is mixed up at the moment, as it was actually Carolina's turn last week and she refused to do it and scheduled the Cyborgs in.
If that all happened already, I don't know. Correct me if anything of the above is wrong.
thanks for the info Thomas, actually Alfredo contacted me this evening to meet us at Lacuna to discuss our exhibition. I think what he expects is a rough program from us- what will be there. I think I could postpone the meeting with him for next week, though I will be not around then, as I'll be travelling.

What are your thoughts about this? Can we put together a program tomorrow?
I've been contacted by Lieke- she would like to have an abstract of our exhibition by early next week. If we are able to throw something together by then, we would get a feature in the ExBerliner magazine ( http://www.exberliner.com ). Moreover she was asking for a picture to use for the feature and the Spektrum website- do you guys think we can put something together by then? I don't think it's gotta be more than 100 words.
Generally I would suggest that we do it, something we all are happy with. Anybody volunteering for taking over the responsibility for that? 
Yeah, we should have a brief chat what we want to use as a picture for them. Maybe anybody who has got an opinion about this can write what their thoughts are, so we can proceed ASAP. Let's make this loop short, please everybody, throw your opinion in a mail and let us know until tomorrow evening what you think. Even info from people that they don't care would be helpful! Thanks Peter for caring already.

Nobody is responsible for that, yet. I am doing the communication with Spektrum at least, so that might be me, even? 
For three days, Spektrum is overgrown by Lacuna Lab, a Berlin-centred collective of trans-disciplinary artists. For the collective's inaugural exhibition, spores of ideas waft across the canal from their studio on Paul-Lincke-Ufer, taking root as a multi-channel network of biology- and technology-based pieces. These objects and installations draw input from their surroundings in Spektrum, the audience, and one another, creating a playful environment of screens, textiles, lights, lasers, plants, water vapor, and interwoven generative sounds. Featuring an interactive dance / audio performance and a campfire coding session, this exhibition investigates collaboration, perception, growth and decay. 
Lieke was asking for more pictures in order to announce the exhibition on their website. I agreed but asked for time until Wednesday (23.03.) at least. In regards of this, it would be great for everybody to think about possible motifes of the works you are the owner of. And possible take pictures already. 

Thomas and me usually got the drinks and we discussed that having prices higher than in the späti is a bit weird. At the same time we're taking care to not get too expensive stuff, that's where the 1€ rumor is from. And theoretically we're still gaining money with 1€ per bottle.
For workshops or other events we could keep the 1,50€.
yea, these questions are helpful- lets make a quick status-update round?
plus it would be good to clarify our connections. so we could make some kind of diagram of the works and how they interact. though it could be im the only one who isnt up to date on that, as ive been gone for a while. 
of course, thanks Thomas for lining this up for us.

As I am the one in contact with Spektrum, I need to set a deadline for you, to fill out the Excel sheet that Thomas provided. That deadline is Saturday (tomorrow) evening/night, so I have things to work with when communicating with Spektrum on Sunday. 

Tomorrow I'm taking some photos for them- does anybody have a camera of better quality than iPhone6?
Aurelia, that thing already has been manifested as an issue on github. At somebody somebody will work on a couple of them.

Do you remember when we were talking about giving each of us a subtitle? I recon that would give a bit of clarity about what kind of people are at Lacuna. At the same time this is kind of self-explanatory in contrast to writing more general explanatory text. I would be a fan of that subtitle collection- who else?

	Balance in skills of members. Too many programmers? Is anyone who can program a programmer? What kinds of skills do we want in the Lab? Diversity is important for us.
Maybe it's more important how they collaborate with the group?
Make it clear to new temporary members that it's not a trial to become a permanent member, because we can't take more people right now.
Voting may not be the ideal approach to choose new members. We should have a discussion, in which people can express their opinions about the new member.
We need to be more clear about what positions are available at the Lab (temporary, permanent, residency, etc).
Residences replace trials. So In case residents wants to join, they can get on the waiting list directly.
Are we full yet?: 12 yes, 2 no.
Define the process of subletting your space temporarily. It should be for a month or more. The person leaving can suggest a replacement. How to speed up the process?
Do we need to take a replacement when leaving? Or maybe we are getting enough income to just not pay without causing much financial trouble.
Short term visits can join anyway.
Where is Peter's position? Next to the window, next to Nenad's location.

Alex has a full time job and is leaving the Lab. Peter and Jerry are the newest members. Derk is a new temporary member.

How do we evaluate if candidates (possible new members) align with our goals.
Quickstart guide for new permanent members.
What kind of events do we want to host? Under what conditions? What are the rules?
We discuss the last party that took place at the Lab.
We also discuss that every day members have more rules and communication than the Cyborg members, who do not know much about our every day processes. How to make the Cyborgs more aware of what goes on in the Lab and how things work?

Task
Have a discussion between 2 or 3 Lacuna Lab people and the Cyborgs e.V. We need to know who is responsible for the events.
Invite Cyborgs representative to future Lacuna meetings so they know about our problems and processes, and they are aware about how to handle their events at Lacuna Lab. Maybe Enno is not the best candidate because he is often too busy to know what goes on in the Lab.
aBe -> start (via e-mail) a discussion about what are the rules for public events, so everyone can voice their concerns.
We explained what the Satzung is, that it is based on the Cyborgs e.V. Satzung, and why it needs to be changed.
Explained to everyone what the changes to the Satzung mean.
Getting professional assistance with making changes to the Satzung (re: questions about taxes, etc.)
Explanation of the problematic areas in the Satzung and why it is necessary to vote (i.e. no. of Chairpersons, and/or board members) 
It was discussed that an e.V. board can consist of up to seven people and that it usually has two chairpeople, one treasurer and one secretary (but can have up to three more members). Although members expressed interest in having a treasurer and secretary, the fact that nobody knows the official language to amend the Satzung, we agreed to simply add more chairpeople.
Then we found wording in another Satzung for adding board members (not chairpeople) and amended the Satzung for that.
Sarah, Aurélia, Ramin and Thomas were nominated as new board members
We take a look at the new Web site in progress and the logo.
We discuss working for others for money. We need legal advice about how can we create projects and charge money.
Future Lacuna Lab collaborative exhibition at Spektrum in April. Discuss more in the next Lacuna Swing, October 18th.
Checking mail box. (wischi does this every day he is here)
Ordering household material for Lacuna (todo: a list to collect items to order) (toilet paper, dish soap, hand soap, toilet cleaning soap, sponges, air spray, bio trash bags, big plastic trash bags, towels for hands, towels for dishes)
Ordering and bringing drinks in, making sure there's enough of them and bringing empty bottles back to the shop
Checking payments by members, notifying members who don't pay.
Scanning invoices and putting them into LexOffice. 
Matching money transactions in bank account to invoices.
Get new members on board (print contracts, key contract and deposit)
Introduction to the tasks for allocation.
Jobs will be assigned to the appropriate committee for overall management.
Individuals choose a sub committee to be part of.
Individuals will be assigned jobs to take responsibility for within their subcomittee
for but do not have to attend all the different sub committee meetings if jobs fall in multiple groups.
Discussion around how to gauge  how long each task takes and whether we need to calculate task times and even this work load.  Undecided if this is a good idea or not.
Establish project leaders (to facilitate action across others)
Goal: to get things done, understand who to go for for what, to support fairness/engagement/trust, liberation of not having to remember everyone
Question: how to keep track/enforce of WIP tasks, and make sure it doesn't all sit on everyone's shoulders?
There's many tasks to be done at the space. How to make sure everyone is involved and not all work is done by a few members? We discuss several options. At a food cooperative, members must do tasks every month and they get "apples" (points). Ordering food consumes apples. If they run out of apples, the can't order food.
What if people don't join any subcommitees? Maybe we need to all join at least one.

Clear main table, put everything on the beamer table in main room.
Inform people of the main room 5 days before the workshop is happening. This information needs to be forwarded to residents, who are not on the mailing list manually.
Remove bills from the drink donation box and store it in the hidden money box.
Inform participants about drink prices and general guidelines. E.g. Cleaning used glasses, taking care of temporary setups like slime molds, paintings and the like
The organizer(s) have to take care that only participants enter the space.
Clean kitchen sink after workshop
Clean main table after workshop, put leftovers where they were or inform the mailing list about things that have been moved away.
Personally, I want the Lab to be a place to work and collaborate. I'm not comfortable with having parties at the Lab. I don't want to spend time on securing things, and I don't see the benefit. I don't mind celebrating birthdays with the Lab members and close friends, but inviting random people is not something I would do. Initially we wanted to exhibit stuff at the Lab and we decided it would not work, and that we would make exhibitions at external places like Spektrum. Making parties does not really align with that decision.
I follow aBe's logic here. If we are not having exhibitions then whyLac would we have parties. If I understand correctly the reasoning for not having exhibitions was that the space was primarily to be used for creating, working, holding workshops etc. and not for generally public events (though personally I thought having exhibitions would be cool). While I like the idea of having parties and big events, if we were to do it, we'd have to do it right, and that means putting all valuables and breakables in a locked area, someone on the door (being prepared to refuse entrance to messy people and charging a small fee for cleaning), limiting the number of attendants, operating a bar (only Lacunans at the fridges), being prepared to kick people out if they act like dicks, etc, etc. Having said all that I'd like to hear a contrasting viewpoint.
What should we say here? Art installations? Prototypes with simple low power electronics, cheap small computers (Arduino, Raspberry PI), LED lights, low power motors and servos?
I'd agree with Art installations, cause this automatically makes it 'less serious' for the insurance and we're better off.
I would also agree with Art installations. I wouldn't be too specific, unless they ask for it.
I would say no. I guess that's to insure us from defective products we sell. If one of us gets into selling products, shouldn't that person get such an insurance?
I would say that the work we're doing in the lab can potentially be sold. Even if it's 'just' software prototypes or whatever.
What are the Pros for saying that the Prototypes might be sold?
Hm, the more I think about it, the less it makes sense to state something like that. Because there are no real products whatsoever being produced and sold. And you're right, there is no pro, just cons having to further justify something that's not happening, really.
I think they could be sold, or money could be made with them. But I think it's not going to be consumer mass products.
Art related software? Software that produces generative graphics and sound, software that takes input from sensors and produces output (graphics, sound, motors, LEDs), used in the context of art and art installations. (to distinguish it from a software development company).
I would say freelance software development. Referring to e.g. Arturo.
I think they want to hear, that we are not dealing with sensitive data or money – which we aren't, right?
No. At least Lacuna is not selling software. I would say that if a member is selling software, maybe that member should get an insurance, if desired, for that activity.
Yeah, I see we need to make sure that they get that we're not a business and things are being worked on without a traditional commercial profit. I would say no, to.
Okay, but how about projects we are working on collaboratively? The project members would have to get their own insurance? Lacuna should then probably only support and be insured for scientific and nonprofit Lab work?
This pad is for brainstorming about potential project ideas, no matter how vague or undeveloped.

Throwing your ideas in a central place gives other members the opportunity to comment and help develop the ideas further, potentially leading to interesting collaborations that might not have otherwise happened!

It was initially created for the Lacuna External Activation Exhibition, but it can be useful going forward as a sort of "garden" of ideas that can be curated and harvested.

Remember, the point of brainstorming is to start a conversation--any and all ideas are welcome!
maybe something that takes a wide-range of inputs?  e.g., a scanner that responds to the colour or shape of an object and then does something algorithmically with that information in the art piece...
something that evolves - people stayed with Tom's drawing robots for a long time - they could see direct image of their intervention, but how the robot might move was still unpredictable. And it was just plain fun. Same for projector installations that draw how moving particles react to your motions. 
Agree with the above. Ongoing engagement means there is (either in reality or in illusion)  the ability for users to curate variations that are specific to their participation. Otherwise, if it's happening with or without me, why contribute?
Maybe it's about having people do something, not just observe and listen? There is a task to do, something to construct or build, a game to play, a process to understand which is not obvious. Exploration time required.
How to make people interact? How to show previous people if you are alone in the exhibition? How to make it necessary for people to cooperate to make things happen?
That idea we talked about a while ago where people had to complete a circuit by touching was a really great one, I thought
like, showing footprints? or maybe their essence floated to the ceiling.  In the science gallery, they had a scanning table where you could put stuff on the conveyor belt, and an image of your object was taken, and other objects that people had placed on the belt were also shown at the same time. maybe a projector installation where people are like transparent lenses so overlapping people would have a compound effect - would probably have to model people parts as simplified objects to make the calculation.
Traces of some kind is an interesting concept - either traces of person-space (pathmaking), or person-person
How to let visitors be the authors of the piece, while at the same time seeing/hearing a noticeable reaction to their actions?
 Sounds like the tapdance thing Aurelia's been thinking about..
ja!
this could be many things - would wasabii's typewriter project fulfill this? just to get an idea what you are thinking
Playing a game-like installation that produces beautiful results? How could they take their creation home? (sending an e-mail, tweet to them with an image or video file?)
Like playing pong or frogger, where the joystick info is feed into a drawing program? The playing view and the drawing view could be disconnected. Or, it could make a physical object, like dripping hot wax in the pattern being controlled by the player, or a 3d printer being live controlled. or light on photosensitive paper. Could one operate one of those heat sensitive paper printers like an x-y plotter - or the heat-sensitve paper printer could print a time evolution as the person played. (sorry, that was a stream of consciousness dump)
there's also been a project floating around since my last collective that was never realized - to create custom experience "camera devices" which have a shutter release based on some kind of interactive input. For example, if there was a swing in an play-themed exhibition, swinging past a certain height takes a picture, and populates a photo gallery of participants in action. Something like this could work well with this new printer a couple friends are working on : http://alfredprinter.com/ Otherwise, if you're going more for a physical take away, I like Claudine's ideas above:)
Objects, ideally old and obviously non digital (made out of wood or metal) in a room. They can be moved, rotated, relocated. Changes on them produce changes is sound, lights, visuals. You move a book and a desk lamp changes its intensity. You open a book and sounds come out from inside a table. Things like that, that make you wonder how is it possible, and make you want to find the links between things. It should look more like and old living room than a high tech lab. No cables or arduinos visible. Like a stage in a theatre, with an old arm chair, curtains, a candle, a newspaper from 1928.
