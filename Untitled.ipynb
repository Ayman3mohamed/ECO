       "Acknowledgments Thank you to JoAnn Guilmett from the Plymouth State University Lamson Library and Learning Commons for helping me to create the initial presentation on which this book is based .\n",
       "Thank you to Elaine Allard for teaching the librarians of New Hampshire about the ideas behind a learning commons .\n",
       "Thank you to Russ Harland , who read and reread the manuscript during one cold and stormy February vacation .\n",
       "He ’ ll be finishing his MLS in 2011 and looking for a library of his own .\n",
       "Thank you also to Mark Halloran for the support he has given to the library , and to Dr. Ethel Gaides for the support she has given to the librarians .\n",
       "Thank you to Erika Frank for sharing a well-designed vision in librarianship , and to Heather Armitage for inspiring me to keep writing .\n",
       "Introduction Our libraries are no longer book rooms , and adding computers into the mix does not make them computer rooms .\n",
       "We need to create a space that fosters collaborative work and social interaction amongst all of our users .\n",
       "When talking to librarians , we explain that we originally based our library program on the learning commons model at Plymouth State University ’ s Lamson Library .\n",
       "Our common goal is that we provide a single centralized location for all users to get help on all of the complex issues of teaching , researching , and being a student or teacher at our school .\n",
       "The learning commons idea is the library world ’ s answer to the changing informational and technological needs of today ’ s learners as well as a shift in pedagogical models .\n",
       "A proper learning commons is also constantly reevaluating the program and looking toward new ways to provide a space in which all users are learning collaboratively , experimenting with technologies , and customizing the space .\n",
       "In our learning commons , we encourage our faculty to serve as facilitators , and our students to have open discussions free of evaluation .\n",
       "One of the most common misconceptions that I have found when describing the learning commons idea to the uninitiated is that people often assume that I am recommending that we simply invest money into more computers or other technologies into the current library .\n",
       "People mistakenly believe that broadening services in the area of technology and spending a lot of money will magically shift a library into a learning commons , but I ’ m here to tell you differently .\n",
       "All you need to do is to shift your way of thinking from being the protector of information and resources to being the advocate for unfettered access to information and resources .\n",
       "Much like the way in which we share information through open-source software and tools , a learning commons is a space staffed by professionals who want to make all resources and information sources available to all users .\n",
       "We recently had several faculty members retire , and as we prepared for the transition and the parties , I went through our archived yearbook collection to find some classic snapshots of our retirees .\n",
       "The frightening thing to me was looking at the pictures of our classrooms and instructional facilities from 30 years ago and noticing that not much had changed .\n",
       "The hairstyles back then were funny , and everyone wore glasses .\n",
       "The chalkboards have been replaced with interactive whiteboards but are being used for the same thing .\n",
       "Teachers now simply type their lecture notes into PowerPoint instead of writing in chalk .\n",
       "Today , our students now have access to a virtual high school , and schools all over the country are looking toward moving more coursework online so that users have continual access to the information and resources that an old-fashioned brick-andmortar school and classroom provides .\n",
       "With access to so much information and the exponential growth of new technologies , learners and teachers of today need a professional to guide them .\n",
       "We need to be sure that we are providing the right kind of space , resources , and services for all of our users .\n",
       "A Note to Administrators The ideas described in this book are inexpensive , sometimes cost-saving ideas .\n",
       "These seven simple steps will streamline your library users ’ information seeking and processing methods , provide your library users with the ability to adapt easily to the future , and encourage all of your faculty and staff to work together .\n",
       "In order to adapt easily to changing roles and technologies , our spaces and staff need to remain flexible .\n",
       "Changes should be made based on what the user ’ s needs are , not on what is more convenient for the library staff .\n",
       "Barriers of all types need to be removed and exchanged for a trust in all of our users .\n",
       "Technology needs to be ubiquitous , and most of it should be transparent to users .\n",
       "The most difficult aspect of this shift in library experience is helping a librarian to change from being a guardian and protector of information and resources to being a guide to information and resources .\n",
       "A librarian also needs to develop the skills in technology planning and use .\n",
       "A computer is no longer just a computer .\n",
       "A computer can be a social equalizer , providing students who do not have access to the Internet at home the means to create a social identity online to rival those of the most upper-class students .\n",
       "A computer can be a digital portfolio of all of a user ’ s academic work and digital personal life .\n",
       "Computers may be mobile , they may have installed digital media readers , and they may have movie-editing software .\n",
       "Every library needs a professional who can understand what the users need and provide timely access to those resources .\n",
       "But most importantly , a librarian needs to be an advocate for all learners .\n",
       "People enjoy seeing quantifiable statistics with any change , and library services are easy to count and keep track of .\n",
       "Expect publications in the form of monthly statistical reports as well as newsletter-type stories with descriptions of the changes and the impact on the library and the rest of the community .\n",
       "User-Centered Design is a popular software design philosophy and process in which the user ’ s needs are given priority over all other options .\n",
       "By taking this philosophy and transferring it to library redesign , we can make our libraries the most user-friendly spaces on campus .\n",
       "Before your next physical or virtual library redesign , think about the following questions .\n",
       "Try to think of everybody who might use your library in the future .\n",
       "It may be difficult for you to focus on what a student is thinking when they walk into your library without being influenced by what you learned in school about what a library should look like—or more likely , what your own library experience may be .\n",
       "Many libraries use a legacy-centered model , using the same design ideas that librarians have used for decades and even centuries .\n",
       "Your library may have an ingrained tradition that you hesitate to change because it has worked for years .\n",
       "The first step to shifting your library is to let go of some of these guidelines .\n",
       "The shift is brought about by the need for new services , tools , and resources .\n",
       "One basic change that you can make is in the use of language in your library .\n",
       "Most libraries are categorized , arranged , and labeled using language from the lexicon of librarians .\n",
       "Instead , use simple and descriptive terms that any user can understand .\n",
       "Label the areas of your library clearly and then use that language while talking to your users .\n",
       "One of our goals is to teach students about the structure of libraries , but let ’ s make sure that they know how to use our resources before we begin teaching them the specialized language of our profession .\n",
       "We do not want to send students off to the next academic level without an understanding of these terms , so be sure to include lessons on specialized language with more advanced classes .\n",
       "Another aspect of user-centered design is taking all of the cultural information that you have and combining it with the observations you have made , the interviews you have conducted , and all other collected data to analyze and brainstorm your results .\n",
       "When you talk to students , they may not be able to articulate the exact ideas that you implement .\n",
       "Instead , they will point you in the right direction .\n",
       "You may observe a student who seems annoyed at having to come back to your desk to get a second red marker because the one she was using had dried up .\n",
       "Note this reaction and consider some different alternatives .\n",
       "Think about how you might explain what each database is best used for in future collaborative lessons .\n",
       "Users will not be able to tell you specifically how to redesign your Web site , but their questions and frustrations will guide you in the right direction .\n",
       "When you hear complaining and whining , prick up your ears and Figure 1.1 .\n",
       "If you can make a change to prevent future complaints , do it right away .\n",
       "Keep a keen eye on how your users utilize your facility and the resources held within .\n",
       "The more we understand how our users are using our resources and adapt our facilities toward them , the more relevant our libraries will become .\n",
       "As you learn more about your users , you will see that their needs are constantly changing , and the best learning commons will be able to adapt to their users ’ needs .\n",
       "The Plymouth Model In 2006 , we had a basic legacy-design library .\n",
       "Yearbooks , gluesticks , and other resources that students wanted to use on a daily basis were kept behind the large counter that served as the information desk .\n",
       "This desk essentially spanned across the entire front half of the library .\n",
       "The counter served as a large barrier between the library staff and the users .\n",
       "It also protected our most-used resources from the users who needed them .\n",
       "We had a room filled with dust-collecting slide projectors , never-used laser-disc players , and a historical archive of projector bulbs going back nearly 40 years .\n",
       "We had televisions and VCRs hooked up to our cable connection allowing the professional librarian to record television broadcasts for classroom use .\n",
       "We also had a large selection of seldom-used print periodicals .\n",
       "The magazines were housed in spinning literature racks that blocked out the cover of each magazine , only revealing the top two inches of each cover page , occasionally revealing the actual title of the magazine .\n",
       "We had a security system that went off several times per day as students found it entertaining to place a library book in an unsuspecting student ’ s backpack .\n",
       "The library staff would get flustered , the students would all laugh , and we would inevitably find a book about human sexuality or something equally humiliating for the backpack wearer .\n",
       "Incoming freshmen would come in for an introductory lesson on how to use the library .\n",
       "Each class came in with their English teachers , and the librarians would show them a digital slide presentation with the rules of the library .\n",
       "Students were excited to enter the library but were soon distracted and bored while watching the presentation and listening to us talk about what they were not allowed to do in the library .\n",
       "Nothing seemed crazy or out of the ordinary .\n",
       "It was business as usual for most libraries for the past several decades .\n",
       "When looking critically at our 2006 legacy-model , we were hard-pressed to find significant value in our system .\n",
       "We spent that school year watching our users and how they used our library .\n",
       "We talked to students about what they really needed in a library .\n",
       "We listened to teachers who came in requesting resources and then watched to see how they used them .\n",
       "We created different surveys for school employees and for parents , too .\n",
       "We spent the summer of 2007 reviewing the survey results and making some very basic changes to our library .\n",
       "We purchased some inexpensive office supply organization bins .\n",
       "We recommend that you not use old coffee cans , shoe boxes , and milk crates .\n",
       "We strive to establish and maintain a professional atmosphere in our learning commons .\n",
       "We are trying to expose our users to what a professional experience will be like when they are not in school .\n",
       "Creating a professional atmosphere also raises expectations and helps to set a tone for being in the library and using the library ’ s resources .\n",
       "Allow students open access to these supplies—you ’ ll be surprised at how many of the supplies do not disappear .\n",
       "You will have an initial onslaught of disappearing scissors and rulers , but as the students get used to the fact that these supplies are not going away , your users will become more trustworthy and honest about returning the supplies .\n",
       "A secondary benefit of providing users with unlimited office supplies is that teachers will notice that their classroom supplies are remaining stocked .\n",
       "Students tend to use the supplies provided in a centralized location like the library .\n",
       "Your principal will notice that teacher supply accounts are not being fully spent , so you may approach him or her with a request to increase the library supply account .\n",
       "Encourage your principal to talk to teachers about their supply accounts , and you may end up with a budget increase .\n",
       "This includes the supplies that we need to run the library , too .\n",
       "Another benefit to keeping your supplies in organizational bins is portability .\n",
       "Students can take an entire bin of markers or colored pencils to their table to work , rather than bringing their work up to the supplies .\n",
       "Watch your users and see how they are using supplies to create finished products .\n",
       "Put yourself in the shoes of a student and ask how you would want supplies to appear .\n",
       "Think about creating a workshop-type environment for your users .\n",
       "In order to create a comfortable atmosphere , go out and look at professional copy centers with work spaces .\n",
       "Be open minded and watch how the users are using and enjoying the space .\n",
       "Pick out the aspects that you could realistically implement in your library .\n",
       "Perhaps the furniture is unreasonable because the cost would prohibit you from purchasing new soft seating , low tables , and bookshelves with outfacing book covers .\n",
       "Be mindful about changes that you could make in your space , and your users will appreciate it .\n",
       "We asked all departments to give us a copy of all current textbooks .\n",
       "Your textbook shelves will be in regular disarray because they will be constantly in use .\n",
       "Students will request fewer trips to their lockers and have fewer excuses for not completing their homework .\n",
       "Our students come to the high school from eight different K–8 schools .\n",
       "Three of those schools have wonderful libraries with full-time librarians providing instruction , collection development , and reader guidance .\n",
       "Two of those schools have combined school-public libraries with the expectation that the students will use only the children ’ s section and leave the adult books to the public .\n",
       "Obviously , our incoming student users have a huge range of prior experience .\n",
       "We try to even the playing field early by inviting the eighth-graders from the schools with the smallest library facilities to visit our library in the spring before they start at the high school .\n",
       "We have the students follow a scavenger hunt through the library and work with the guidance department to include a school tour .\n",
       "We also encourage all of our freshman English and social studies teachers to bring their students to the library as early in the school year as possible in order to expose all of our freshmen to the resources available to them in our library .\n",
       "For their first visit , we have the class sit down in a quiet section of our library .\n",
       "We talk about the resources to which they now have access in their high school library .\n",
       "We then hustle them over to the computers and teach them how to log on to our school network and access our library Web site .\n",
       "If the classes are doing any kind of research project , we show them a single database and demonstrate to them how to use it for their specific assignment .\n",
       "Changing from a text-heavy slide presentation about what they cannot do in the library to hands-on entertaining and integrated lessons keeps our freshmen engaged and allows them to make more relevant connections to the library resources .\n",
       "Technology Accessories sary in any room , especially in our learning commons .\n",
       "They are negative and constant reminders that set the tone of your space as prohibitive .\n",
       "If you must post rules , be creative instead of restrictive .\n",
       "Users appreciate the humor and understand the tone of the space as they first enter the room .\n",
       "We noticed that we were subscribing to a number of expensive professional journals that were rarely being accessed .\n",
       "We decided that instead of attaching a routing list to the journals , we would photocopy the cover page and table of contents and send these packets of information to faculty members who might be interested in the contents .\n",
       "We suddenly had lines of faculty waiting to get their hands on the newest issues of the English Journal and the Science Teacher .\n",
       "By publicizing available resources for our teachers , we increased use of these journals dramatically—many teachers were unaware that we had these titles available at all .\n",
       "We heavily weeded our print reference collection based on access to electronic resources with the same information .\n",
       "We also moved a lot of our single-volume monograph titles from reference to the regular circulating collection .\n",
       "Items that are alphabetical multivolume sets are difficult to circulate , but sets that are divided by topics are also generally moved to our circulating collection .\n",
       "In addition to weeding reference , we heavily weeded the circulating collection .\n",
       "This quickly updated our collection as library users suddenly believed that we had added a lot of new titles without our actually having added any .\n",
       "Weeding is a crucial step to transforming any out-of-date library .\n",
       "Preserving inaccurate and out-of-date materials on your library shelves is one way to demonstrate to your users just how irrelevant print materials really are .\n",
       "We discarded most of the unused audiovisual equipment from our back room and weeded through the light bulbs , taping supplies , and other outdated resources .\n",
       "This freed up space for spreading out our professional collections , digital audiovisual equipment , and video collections .\n",
       "Now when teachers walk into our back room , they barely recognize it as the same space .\n",
       "Keeping library space neat and organized is crucial to demonstrating a professional atmosphere for your users .\n",
       "We also ordered some very simple wall-mounted magazine display racks , such as those in Figure 1.6 .\n",
       "We looked for racks that had Plexiglas fronts so that users could see the entire front cover of each periodical title .\n",
       "We used to dust the periodical racks weekly because users never touched them .\n",
       "We now have to check the displays daily to reorganize , re-alphabetize , and straighten out this popular section .\n",
       "Virtual Library Redesign We redesigned our library Web site based on what our users needed and wanted .\n",
       "In the middle of our observational and evaluative year , our users found an immediate need that we chose to implement quickly .\n",
       "Often , coded text I would send would not translate between vanilla HTML and Dreamweaver , and almost every change required explanation and often more than one revision .\n",
       "We found that students were asking for links to commonly visited Web sites over and over again .\n",
       "I wanted to be able to send the link right to the student ’ s computer , and students expected that I could make this happen .\n",
       "We wanted a tool that allowed us to focus on the content rather than the technology .\n",
       "We initially chose to create the Web site as a wiki ; however , a blog or other Web 2.0–based tool would have suited us just fine , too .\n",
       "On each page , we provided links to Web sites and research hints that we wanted to share with the students .\n",
       "Since we also integrated e-books and virtual resources with our print volumes and brick-and-mortar space , we included access to them on our wiki page .\n",
       "Once you set up your own wiki page , you may realize that your teachers also want to share Web sites with their students—so give your wiki password to all faculty .\n",
       "From The Learning Commons : Seven Simple Steps to Transform Your Library by Pamela Colburn Harland .\n",
       "Maybe you can see where this is going , but back in September 2006 , I never would have believed it .\n",
       "By December 2006 , we had the first students who wanted to share Web sites with their classmates .\n",
       "Soon , you ’ ll be giving out the password to entire classes at one time .\n",
       "We have nearly 800 high school students with full editing capability on 50-plus research wiki pages—and in four years , we have not had a single case of virtual vandalism .\n",
       "By utilizing simple and user-centered designs , you encounter success by offering increased services to your users .\n",
       "As your users gain expertise , they learn to utilize more effectively these simple tools that you have provided them .\n",
       "It isn ’ t always about spending more money on more resources—in this case , it ’ s as simple as taking your existing tools and placing them in a convenient and obvious place so that our users can help themselves .\n",
       "When you put the tools and resources in logical places , your users will eventually and intuitively learn to be more autonomous users of all types of tools and resources .\n",
       "We give them experiential context—we demonstrate where to go for certain types of basic information and resources , and then they extrapolate and apply their new information location skills toward new and more complex information retrieval and use .\n",
       "Your To-Do List 3 Survey your users and your nonusers .\n",
       "From The Learning Commons : Seven Simple Steps to Transform Your Library by Pamela Colburn Harland .\n",
       "In fact , they are usually built for long-lasting preservation and permanence .\n",
       "Libraries that were designed before the big shift in technology integration and student-learning styles are not likely to meet the needs of today ’ s users .\n",
       "In order to prepare for the coming changes , purchase mobile shelving and furniture whenever possible .\n",
       "Most shelving and library furniture is completely static due to its weight , size , and safety issues for your users .\n",
       "However , some library furniture is ideal when looking at mobility and flexibility .\n",
       "Several library furniture companies are now selling affordable mobile shelving and display racks .\n",
       "Some have hidden wheels so they look like motionless shelves , so your users will not be tempted to rearrange your library while you are not looking .\n",
       "It also will not look like you have carts of books left all around your library .\n",
       "Furniture companies are now designing mobile furniture in several different styles to fit in with the look of your school and library .\n",
       "The twenty-first-century learner is looking for a space that allows for social and interactive learning .\n",
       "When planning your library space , consider how your physical and virtual spaces promote learning rather than distract from it .\n",
       "Students are not looking for private and singular study carrels at which to work .\n",
       "Today ’ s students need spaces where they can meet with other students and be seen by other library users , as seen in Figure 2.1 .\n",
       "In addition to purchasing furniture that is light and mobile , also be prepared to allow your users to move the furniture to suit their needs .\n",
       "This may be difficult to do , but give it a try .\n",
       "Allowing users to create and modify their own learning spaces should make it easier on you .\n",
       "By watching how users want to use the space and resources , you will get additional ideas for making your space even more user-centered .\n",
       "Allow the library design to be fluid , and the users will personalize their own learning environments .\n",
       "Some students will move a single chair to the book stacks in order to read in a quiet location surrounded by books .\n",
       "Allow the users to experiment with what works best for them for each project that they do .\n",
       "Also be sure to create library spaces that are scalable and sustainable .\n",
       "Think about all of the different uses of the library space , and be sure that the space is comfortable for a wide variety of uses .\n",
       "Building a library with dozens of empty shelves and a budget that will not fill them anytime soon is frustrating , rather than forward-thinking .\n",
       "We made one of the units our new book display rack .\n",
       "We keep it full of new books , and when we have not ordered any new books in a long time , we create special themed displays on these racks .\n",
       "Another one of our mobile shelving units is used to display school textbooks .\n",
       "The final unit is used to display our reserve books .\n",
       "We placed several mobile shelving units in amongst our computer lab area and were surprised to observe how much serendipitous learning occurred every day .\n",
       "We stood together and looked through the book until he decided that he would check it out and show it to his father at home that night .\n",
       "The next day , he returned the book and told me that he had never before seen his father read a book until he brought home the covered bridges book .\n",
       "A single moment of accidental learning , reading , and sharing like this was worth the cost of all the mobile shelving to me .\n",
       "Along with most schools , we are faced with constant administrative mandates .\n",
       "Each year we have a new directive , such as digital portfolios , to which we need to adapt .\n",
       "Our principal saw that students came to the library to ask for help and to utilize our technology , so he moved the digital portfolio teacher into the library .\n",
       "Directives like these require flexibility on all parts : furniture , attitudes , and technology .\n",
       "It seemed crucial to me that we set up a temporary space for our digital portfolios .\n",
       "The space looks permanent , but will not impact the library in any negative way if she either moves to her own classroom or we stop requiring our students to produce digital portfolios .\n",
       "We did have a custom sign made to match the other signs in the library .\n",
       "While we want to create a consistent look in the library , we also simply want to be able to change it easily and inexpensively .\n",
       "Migrate your Web presence to a wiki , blog , or some other easily updated tool .\n",
       "You need to be able to update your Web site instantly , and your users expect that you can do it .\n",
       "Some schools are using tools that enable teachers and librarians to create their own Web content , but if you are unable to make changes as the needs arise , suggest to your Web developer that your library page link directly to your own Web site .\n",
       "All librarians need to have constant and immediate access to a simple-to-use Web tool .\n",
       "Our presence on the Web needs to be flexible because the information that we provide is always changing based on the needs of our users .\n",
       "Content has to follow those changes and be dynamic .\n",
       "Your Web interface with your users may change all of the time based on what your users are looking for at different times .\n",
       "Blogs and other Web 2.0 tools are perfect because they are easy to edit , free , and simple to share .\n",
       "You can eliminate the webmaster by making updates to your Web site a one-step process .\n",
       "Be sure to share the administrative passwords with the entire library squad and be sure that everyone is equally trained on simple updates .\n",
       "Nothing is more frustrating for your staff than if you control all Web content but are out of the library when an update or change is needed and they do not have access to the Web site .\n",
       "Sharing the responsibility also relieves you of some of the pressure .\n",
       "Your Web site also needs to be sustainable .\n",
       "Do not set up a blog if you are unable to update it weekly .\n",
       "Once you set up a blog or wiki , practice making updates so that it becomes second nature for you .\n",
       "Updates do not have to be complex , but the more you make small changes , the easier it will become .\n",
       "If your Web presence is scalable , you will have the ability to add single pages as the need arises .\n",
       "Do not create a complicated and deep Web site unless your users need that level of complexity for their information needs .\n",
       "We built our Web site at school , but when we went home and checked our site on higher-resolution monitors and lower-resolution laptops , we noticed some subtle differences .\n",
       "We created this user-friendly Web site but if our users are unable to access the information from their device , then the site is useless in that instance .\n",
       "The Plymouth Model Web Site We began by using a free wiki for our users .\n",
       "After several years of simple updates , we decided to migrate to a more complex solution .\n",
       "In our case , our wiki provider had drastically changed several features in the middle of the school year .\n",

       "Your library is thriving with inquiry , curious researchers , and sharing of information and resources .\n",
       "In order to keep your library relevant to the needs of your community , you need to make a change .\n",
       "The fundamental change is an attitudinal shift from being the protector and guardian of a legacy to being the guide to the exponential growth of the Internet and the resources that reside there .\n",
       "As you make this shift , there will be intimidating moments , but not making a change is even scarier .\n",

       "In order to lower the volume , be prepared to hand out headphones to your users .\n",
       "As everyone incorporates more audiovisual resources into projects , headphones will silence a lot of the background noise and isolate some of the students .\n",
       "Allowing your users to wear headphones may be a change in policy in your building , but it can greatly assist noise issues in a social space , and listening to music while working may help users to stay more focused on their own work .\n",
       "You may also find that faculty members who do not actually use the learning commons may assume that the library is now being used as a glorified , noisy study hall .\n",
       "Some departments may not support the new mission of the learning commons and refuse to send students or utilize services as their vision of a traditional library is not being met .\n",
       "Publicity will help to teach everyone what the goals in the new learning commons are .\n",

       "Many learning commons allow food and drink in order to create an even more social environment .\n",
       "This can generate a whole new set of issues within your library space .\n",
       "Local libraries that have changed their food-and-drink policy have surprisingly noticed that trash pickup is much easier .\n",
       "They noticed an immediate difference in users no longer hiding food packages and sneaking drink containers around the space .\n",
       "Our users often leave food wrappers and empty cups on top of the computers because it is a well-hidden space to hide their precious contraband .\n",

       "Above all other things , your users need to be your libraries ’ main focus .\n",
       "Our focus should be on making locating information easier on them , and at the same time , it becomes easier on us .\n",
       "Once you trust and teach your users to be autonomous learners in your learning commons , they will teach themselves to locate the tools and resources that they need .\n",
       "We give them the basic experiential context in which to find certain information , and then they will extrapolate and apply that towards new and more complex information retrieval and use .\n",
       "Next , be sure that your shift is made with flexibility and mobility in mind .\n",
       "You do not want to make a decision today that reflects some current fad or recent layout idea .\n",
       "Keep your redesigns , both physical and virtual , flexible .\n",
       "While libraries are often the space of permanence and a historic archive of materials , some aspects must be easily adaptable for the fast-paced changes in technology that we face on a daily basis .\n",
       "Let go of some control over your space and trust your users to customize the facility and resources themselves .\n",
       "While looking at changes in your space , look to other departments with whom you can share resources .\n",
